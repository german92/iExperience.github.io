  <h2>E1: Logic games</h2>
<p>
  Below are a set of logic puzzles. Try to guess the output of each line. To check your answers type (don't copy-paste) the expression into <code>irb</code>.
</p><pre><code>!true && false
true && false
true && !false
x = 6
x < 7 && x > 5
x <= 6 || x < 5
x < 5 || x > 5
(x = 7) && true # Be careful!
x</code></pre>
<h2>E2: Too Old for the Club</h2>
<p>
  Create a new folder for today if you haven't already, called <code>d2</code>. In it, create a new program called <code>strict_bouncer.rb</code>. that gets the age from the console and allows only those in the rage <code>21 <= age < 65</code> into the club.
</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
20
Too young, fool!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
65
Go back to the nursing home!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
64
Aw yeah c'mon in.</code></pre>
<h2>E3: Quiz App</h2>
<p>
  In <code>d2</code>, create a mini quiz that prompts for answers and checks if they are right. Your quiz should have at least 3 questions, and keep track of how many the user got right. Use questions about yourself so your friends can learn about you when they take it!
</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby mini_quiz.rb
Welcome to Rafi's mini quiz.
What's my last name?
Khan
Right! You have 1 point.
How many siblings do I have?
2
Wrong...I don't have any. You have 1 point.
What country was I born in?
Bangladesh
Nice! You have 2 points.
Thanks for playing!</code></pre>
<p class="hint">A user experience concern: how do you know when to display <code>"point"</code> and when to use <code>"points"</code>? Nothing says n00b like a message that reads "You have 1 points". The given answer doesn't address this question, but yours should!</p>
<span class="hover-show pull-right">Hover for answer</span>
<div class="hover-hide">
  <pre><code><span class="comment"># mini_quiz.rb</span>

  puts <span class="string">"Welcome to Rafi's mini quiz."</span>
