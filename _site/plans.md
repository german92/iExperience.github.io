# Plans for iX Web Presence

### Landing page
- Public information about iExperience 
- Apply for the program

### Zendesk
- Pre coursework
- Information about weekend activities
- Resources for Cape Town (guide to Cape Town)
- "Ticket" system / commenting
- Knowledge base / asking questions
- Easy for non-coders to add pages

### Course (Github)
- Course calendar
  - Should this include weekend activities / nightly restaurant outings. 
  - A iX session calendar? 
- Slides and exercises

## GOALS
- Eventually move all content off the Zendesk and onto the Github.io page, which will be linked to via a iX subdomain (course.ixperience.co.za or equivalent)
- Teach iX members how to create pages on Github.io (make how to guide and template files)
  - Consider adding [Disqus](http://disqus.com) to each page if people want to comment. 
- Build UI for adding articles/pages?


## TODO
- Create Google group for each session
