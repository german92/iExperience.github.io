# Live by principles

There’s probably no “right” way to TA, but these are the principles by which I, Rafi, try to help others. The overarching themes are to be proactive, adaptive, and try your best to love your peers and your work.

# Be legit

But first, there's no substitute for knowing the material. You can't take shortcuts here, and shouldn't try to. You guys all have your own Ruby and Rails experiences, but no matter what your level, every day before class, you should review what the topic is, *especially* if you're giving the lecture. It may be something you've done dozens of times, but it never hurts to glance at the documentation to prepare yourself. If you notice, all the times I "happen" to look up documentation during a code-along or lecture, it's always a visited link. This is something that is the first priority, and you should work on before anything else: be a pro at the material.

At the same time, recognize there's only so much you can do—a lot comes from experience and just being familiar with error messages and concepts. When you genuinely don't know, rely on your intuition, which you can hone using the debugging guide. We'll get to that later.

And lastly, don't be afraid to ask for help. Be a team that trusts each other—but don't abuse that trust. Look for help only when you're *really* stuck, and learn from each other; once a problem is solved, you should know the solution to it.

### The way Rafi did it

I've simply done Rails for a long time—3 years now. I've spent a lot of time with it, and other MVC frameworks. I've learned what design patterns work, and the "proper" way to do things—which almost always exists in Ruby and Rails and can be found easily on Google. I did those searches and I struggled with those error messages. You might not have the same experience, but approach every error as a learning opportunity, not a failure, and *actually* learn from it. Don't make mistakes twice. 

# Build relationships

It really helps to improve your "legitimacy persona" if you take the time to build individual, personal relationships with students. Hang out with them as much as possible, and take a genuine interest in their interests. Remember their priorities, personalities and goals. Give individualized attention, pick people out and know when to joke ("Christian, I know you like shopping, why don't you answer this question?"). This is basically a lesson on being a good person, but take a genuine interest in the students. Approach them not just to help them, but to ask how they're doing, and become a friend that they can trust and want to seek help from. 

One thing I did to "win over" the students is buy a round of tequila the first time we all went out. I tried my best (though it was not my true personality) to be outgoing and fun-loving, and taking on awkward conversations head on. That 200 rand on tequila paid huge dividends in not only making people feel generous towards me, but making it easy to open conversations with them. You might not pursue the same choice of gift, but a gift nonetheless helps boatloads. 

# Proactively Adapt

A HUGE part of being a TA is internatlizing feedback and not being offended by criticism. If an exercise is bad, it's bad, and needs to be redone. In a startup this young, it's important to be brutally honest and make sure the product is good. 

Being proactive goes hand in hand with this. I personally am always watching for what Salman does and seeing what things he missed or could have done better, and being proactive about either asking questions about those things in class or making exercises about them. The head lecturer is never going to be perfect, and winning his/her trust makes the job SO much more fun. Once the lecturer trusts you, and students are on your side, you can basically do no wrong. But that starts with being legit, building good relationships with them and the students, and proactively adapting.

# Eyes on the Ground

Another way TAs are really helpful to the company is by being the "eyes on the ground" and being able to be friends with students in a way the lecturer or staff can't/don't want to be. I personally really enjoy hanging out with all the students, and made a point of doing it as much as possible–while also being responsible and respecting the integrity of the program. For example, I would never drag someone away from their project to go out, but am receptive to hang whenever a student wants to. 

Through that, after a couple of weeks, you start getting honest feedback about your performance and that of the company, and the thoughts that people aren't always willing to express in feedback forms. Reporting those (without breaching anyone's trust, of course) helps the whole team improve and cater to the needs of iX.

# Document

Whenever you do something or create something, put just as much effort into making it sustainable. It's great if it's useful for Session 1, but in the long term useless if no one else can use it. Whenever you write code or create a presentation, DOCUMENT it. The iX site Github has a thorough README, and the code is well commented. The slides have lecture notes to guide future lecturers. Hold yourself to this rigorous tradition.

# Love

And lastly, make sure you love your job. This is a startup, and it's rare to have so much freedom in doing whatever you want. If there's a part of your job that you don't like, talk to Aaron, Salman, each other or Darren about changing it—they will help you! And in general, shape the role into something you love to do. If you don't like building relationships, then find another way to connect with students and be helpful to them. Rarely will you find a job that has such a personable, supportive team that are so willing to help you grow as a person and a teacher. For me, this experience has not only been one of the most rewarding of my life, but a source of tremendous personal and professional growth. And I loved every moment!
