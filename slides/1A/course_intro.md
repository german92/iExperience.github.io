iExperience does not enforce a strict schedule outside of lectures. *We are not your parents*. It's up to you to work at the level you need to maximize your learning, and balance your health. You are responsible for balancing many different goals, including:

* Spend the necessary time to complete exercises, projects and other materials. Work late if you have to. You didn't fly to Cape Town just to slack off.
* Ensure you are well rested enough to pay your *full attention* during lectures. Lectures are the most concentrated, valuable form of learning you will get. You do *NOT* want to miss them (or stare blankly at the wall during them...)
* There are many components to iExperience besides just learning technology -- make the most of your (ridiculously beautiful) surroundings and make this a trip you'll never forget.
* Remember to have fun! The materials will challenge and frustrate you, but this is something you *chose* to do, so make sure to enjoy it as much as possible.

# Keep in Mind

* Lectures are your primary source of material
* Exercises are critical to *complete* your learning. DO THEM!
* Pay attention / participate during in-class walkthroughs. I will aim to improvise as much as possible to give you a sense of the true development process.
* TreeHouse resources are supplemental materials. Use them!
* You are in Cape Town. LIVE here!
