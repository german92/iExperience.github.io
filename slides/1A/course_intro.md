iExperience does not enforce a strict schedule. It's up to you to work at the level you need to maximize your learning and balance your health. There are many components to iExperience besides just learning technology -- keep this in mind and do your best to maximize the opportunity of being here *every single day*.

# Course Goals

1. Learn to *teach yourself*
2. Develop the patience to *deal with failure*

# Keep in Mind

* Lectures are your primary source of material
* Exercises are critical to *complete* your learning. DO THEM!
* Pay attention / participate during in-class walkthroughs. I will aim to improvise as much as possible to give you a sense of the true development process.
* TreeHouse resources are supplemental materials. Use them!
* You are in Cape Town. Live here!
