iExperience does not enforce a strict schedule outside of lectures. *We are not your parents*. It's up to you to balance the many goals of this program:

* Spend the time to complete exercises, projects and other materials. Work late if you have to. You didn't fly to Cape Town just to slack off.
* Ensure you are well rested enough to pay your *full attention* during lectures. Lectures are the most concentrated, valuable form of learning you will get.
* There are many components to iExperience besides just learning technology -- make the most of your (ridiculously beautiful) surroundings and make this a trip you'll never forget.
* Remember to have fun!
