# Ruby Koans

Today, we will work through several of the Ruby Koans together, and then you will work through the rest yourselves as exercises.

# How The Koans Work

* The idea behind the Koans is to utilize testing (& TDD) to understand concepts
* The Koans package comes with a set of tests that verify each koan
* By default, the test are failing, and running the suite will show you that
* You must then go through each Koan, figure out the solution, update it and run it again until that Koan passes
* This is the underlying premise of TDD
