* Ensure you are well rested enough to pay your *full attention* during lectures. Lectures are the most concentrated, valuable form of learning you will get.
* There are many components to *iExperience* besides technology; make the most of your (ridiculously beautiful) surroundings.
* Remember to have fun!
