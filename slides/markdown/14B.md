# Git & GitHub

# Git

* Git is a source control tool that helps you store your code in a __local repository__, as well as track changes to your code over time
* Git allows you to create __branches__ of your code, which are different 'versions' that can exist simultaneously (e.g. an experimental new feature)
* Git, by itself, is extremely valuable as tool for managing your own personal workflow of your code
* Git is also referred to as a __revision control__, __version control__ or __SCM__ (source configuration management) tool
* There are also other SCM tools available (e.g. SVN), but Git is the predominant tool used for web development these days

# Working with Git

There are 3 stages that files in a local Git repo can be in:
<br/><br/>

1. __Untracked / Working__: These are changes we just made, new files we just aded, or files we just deleted
2. __Staged__: These are changes that we have so far approved for future committing
3. __Committed / Versioned__: These are changes we have committed __locally__, which are part of a git commit, and thus have a git commit hash (they are versioned)

# Basic Git Commands

```
$ git init # initialize a new Git repo in current folder
$ git status # observe the current state of Git repo
$ git add . # STAGE/add all the files in the current folder
$ git commit -m # COMMIT files to repo (creates a new version)
```
---
# More Git Commands

```
$ git reset <file(s)> # unstage files ("un-adds" the files)
$ git checkout <file(s)> # restore files to last committed version
$ git commit -am "added login functionality" # adds files and commits
```
---
# Git Stash
#### A.K.A. Salman's Favorite Git Feature

```
// stashes away all current changes in working tree 
// (the -u does a git add first)
$ git stash -u

// re-applies the last stash of changes
$ git stash apply

// shows you all the current stashes
$ git stash list

// applies the stash at position X
$ git stash apply stash@{X}

// same as git stash -u, but allows you to specify a msg to describe changes
$ git stash save -u "failed attempt to get signup working"
```

# Code-Along: Git

Let's create a new Rails app locally, initialize it as a Git repository and experiment with some standard commands.

---
# Git Branches

Git provides the facility to create and store multiple branches of your code. This helps enapsulate "experimental" work into a separate branch, so it does not affect your main line of work.

For this course, you will likely only work with one branch: the default branch, known as ```master```.

---
# Working with Git Branches

```
// see all current branches
$ git branch

// checkout an existing branch
// note - if there is a remote branch with same name,
// this automatically links it to the remote branch
$ git checkout existing_branch

// create a new branch
$ git checkout -b new_branch

// delete a (local) branch
$ git branch -D branch_name
```

# Git Summary

* Great tool for managing your local code
* Allows you to store, track, undo, redo and switch between multiple version of your code
* Tricky to conceptualize everything that is happening, but clarity will come with time and practice

# GitHub

* GitHub is a __remote repository__ in the cloud (i.e. somewhere publicly accessible on the internet)
* GitHub allows you to take your __local__ Git repository and __push__ it to a remote GitHub repository
* There are other sites you can use to store your Git repositories (e.g. BitBucket), but GitHub is the most popular one for Git repositories
* GitHub only works with Git repositories (e.g. SVN repositories cannot be hosted on GitHub)
* GitHub as a tool and GitHub the company has single-handedly pushed forward the open source community by leaps and bounds

# GitHub is awesome. 

They support your work, so try to support them in return.

# Local / Remote Flow

![Local Remote Flow](/images/slides/local-remote-flow.png)

---
# Standard Git+Hub Flow

1. Review your local changes (```git status```)
2. Add & commit all local changes (```git add && git commit```)
3. Fetch / pull latest changes from remote (```git fetch || git pull```)
4. Merge changes to your local repository (```git merge```)
5. Resolve any conflicts
6. Push your new & merged changes to remote (```git push```)

---
# Commit -> Pull -> Push

* Always have a 'clean' working directory before pulling changes (do this by committing or stashing __all__ changes)

* Always try to pull latest changes before pushing.

* If you try to push and other changes have occurred, your push will be rejected. In that case, just pull changes, merge, and try pushing again.

---
# How do I Pull changes?

```
$ # fetches all changes and auto-merges, and creates a merge commit
$ git pull origin master 

OR

$ # 'rebases' your work against the remote changes that have been made
$ git pull - -rebase origin master

```
---
# Pulling vs Rebasing

* Using ```git pull``` auto-merges, which means you are relying on Git to resolve the merge correctly, and creates 'merge commits' in your repo
* Rebasing with ```git pull - -rebase origin master``` does a clean 'catchup' of changes, with no merge commits

---
# Git Pull is Easiest

* For beginners, it is simplest to use ```git pull origin master``` to auto-merge.

* Alternatively, you can try and rebase, and if it conflicts, do a ```git rebase - -abort``` and then do a ```git pull origin master```

# Code-Along: Git+Hub

Let's create a new GitHub repo for our local Git repository, and do some commits alongside another contributor. We may encounter some conflicts, which we'll learn to resolve.
