# Review: Models

* Models are used to simplify working with the database
* We use ActiveRecord models in Rails
* Each resource has a class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base

---

# A closer look at index.html.erb

* How does the @tweets variable get populated with models?

---
# Controllers

* When you hit /tweets, you hit TweetsController
* Since you are hitting the index page, you hit the index method in the controller
* The methods inside a controller are known as *actions*

---
# Index Action

* Populates @tweets with an array of Tweet instances
