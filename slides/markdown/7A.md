# Review: Models

* Application data is stored in a database
* Working with databases is hard, so we use Models to simplify the work
* In Rails, we use ```ActiveRecord``` as the base class for all our models
* We can use ```rails console``` as an enhanced IRB environment that includes our Rails app classes
* ActiveRecord::Base provides us with some Class methods in addition to instance methods

# A closer look at index.html.erb

* How does the @tweets variable get populated with models?

---
# Controllers

* When you hit /tweets, you hit TweetsController
* Since you are hitting the index page, you hit the index method in the controller
* The methods inside a controller are known as *actions*

---
# Index Action

* Populates @tweets with an array of Tweet instances
