# Review: Models

* Models are used to simplify working with the database
* We use ActiveRecord models in Rails
* Each resource has a class that inherits from ActiveRecord::Base

---
## A closer look at ActiveRecord methods

Are these methods being called on an instance?

```ruby
>> Tweet.find(1)

>> Tweet.new

>> Tweet.all
```

---
# Ruby: Class Methods

* Class methods are methods that can only be called on a __Class__
* As it turns out, Classes themselves are objects that can have methods called on them
* ActiveRecord::Base defines a bunch of class methods for us to use (e.g. ```new```, ```find```)

---
# Defining Class Methods

```ruby
class String
	def self.tie
		"I'm all tied up!"
	end
end
```

---
# A closer look at index.html.erb

* How does the @tweets variable get populated with models?

---
# Controllers

* When you hit /tweets, you hit TweetsController
* Since you are hitting the index page, you hit the index method in the controller
* The methods inside a controller are known as *actions*

---
# Index Action

* Populates @tweets with an array of Tweet instances
