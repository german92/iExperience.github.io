# Controllers & Routes

---

# Review: Models

* Application data is stored in a database
* Working with databases is hard, so we use Models to simplify the work
* ActiveRecord provides us with methods to easily work with the database
* We can use ```rails console``` as an enhanced IRB environment that includes our Rails app classes

---
#### IN views/tweets/index.html.erb

> Where does @tweets come from?

* We know it is an array of Tweet instances
* We know Tweet instance responds to methods for its attributes (e.g. ```.body``` and ```.handle```)
* We still don't know how @tweets gets initialized...

---

# Controllers

* Controllers talk to the database, and pass data to the views
* They use Models to talk to the database
* They use instance variables to pass data to the views
* Controllers are custom Ruby classes that inherit from ```ApplicationController```, just like how Models are custom classes that inherit from ```ActiveRecord::Base```

---
# Controller for each Resource

* The same way we have a Model for each resource, we have a Controller for each resource
* For the tweets resource, we have a ```Tweet``` model class, and a ```TweetsController``` controller class
* For the users resource, we have a ```User``` model class, and a ```UsersController``` controller class
* Note the plurality on models (singular) and controllers (plural)

---
# How does it all fit together?

NOTE: Draw a diagram of MVC demonstrating:
- a URL they are hitting (e.g. /tweets)
- goes to a "Routing" box (they dont know this yet, but represent it as Unknown or ???)
- goes to a Controller (show that the UsersController is hit)
- which invokes a method on it (show the :index action is hit)
- which sets up @tweets in a list
- which automatically goes to the index.html.erb view

---
# URL -> Controller -> Method

* When you visit ```/tweets```, it instantiates the TweetsController class and calls the ```index``` method on it
* When you visit ```/tweets/new```, it instantiates the TweetsController and calls the ```new``` method on it
* When you visit ```/users/1/edit```, it instantiates the UsersController and calls the ```edit``` method on it

---
# Actions

Inside a Controller class, the methods (e.g. ```index``` and ```new```) are referred to as __actions__.

---
# Code-Along

Let's take a look at the code inside ```app/controllers``` to get a better sense of what Controller code looks like.

---
# The Map

<table style="margin: 0px auto; border: 1px solid black;width: 80%; padding: 10px;">
	<tr>
		<th>URL</th>
		<th>Action</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/tweets</td>
		<td>TweetsController#index</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/tweets/new</td>
		<td>TweetsController#new</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/tweets/1</td>
		<td>TweetsController#show</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>/tweets/1/edit</td>
		<td>TweetsController#edit</td>
	</tr>
</table>

# Routes

* These mappings of a particular URL pattern onto a particular Controller and Action are known as __routes__
* Routes are how users access your applications (think of them as gateways into your database)
* Eventually, these mappings will become second nature
* In the meantime, you can use a command in your terminal to see all the routes:

```
$ rake routes
```

---
# rake routes

```
$ rake routes
    Prefix Verb   URI Pattern                Controller#Action
    tweets GET    /tweets(.:format)          tweets#index
           POST   /tweets(.:format)          tweets#create
 new_tweet GET    /tweets/new(.:format)      tweets#new
edit_tweet GET    /tweets/:id/edit(.:format) tweets#edit
     tweet GET    /tweets/:id(.:format)      tweets#show
           PATCH  /tweets/:id(.:format)      tweets#update
           PUT    /tweets/:id(.:format)      tweets#update
           DELETE /tweets/:id(.:format)      tweets#destroy
```

> __Q.__ So, where did all these 'routes' come from?
<br/><br/>
> __A.__ Rails Scaffolding created them for you, in the ```routes.rb``` file. A set of routes were created for each __resource__.

---
### routes.rb

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do

  resources :tweets

  resources :users

end
```
---
### routes.rb

* In the routes.rb file, the ```resources``` method allows you to create a collection of routes in one line
* Just by typing ```resources :tweets```, Rails will create all of the routes associated with the tweets resource (e.g. everything we saw in the ```rake routes``` output)
* The ```resources``` method is the simplest way to create a set of CRUD routes for a given resource
* When you scaffold a resource, it places the ```resources``` declaration for the resource in the ```routes.rb``` file automatically

---
# The Complete Picture

NOTE: Return to the diagram, and point out that the previously unknown Routing stage is now done via the Routing that we discussed.

---
# RECAP

* The collection of Model instances (e.g. @tweets) is populated into views by Controllers
* Controllers are custom classes that inherit from ApplicationController
* Routes are the mechanism through which a given url (e.g. /tweets) invokes a particular method (e.g. ```index```) in a controller (e.g. ```TweetsController```)
* Routes are declared in the ```routes.rb``` file, using the simple ```resources``` method.

---
# Code-Along

Let's modify the Twitter app to change the @tweets data set in the Controller before it passes it along to the view.
