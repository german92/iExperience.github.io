# INTRO TO RAILS

If you haven't already, make sure you have the Rails (v4.1.1) installed on your machine.

```
$ gem install rails -v 4.1.1
$ rails -v
```

## A final note on Ruby...

* Remember that learning Ruby is a continuous process
* You still have many resources, exercises and projects to work on in Ruby
* We will be moving our focus over to Rails now, but it is important that you keep looking to improve your Ruby skills
* Many of your skills will improve naturally with experience

## Web Application Architecture

![Web Server Diagram](/images/slides/client-server-diagram-internet.png)

---

# Where does Rails fit in?

* Rails is a web server framework built in Ruby
* It can handle incoming requests from clients and return responses
* Many web servers (e.g. nginx) serve *static* content (i.e. the same page no matter what)
* *Dynamic* web servers, such as Rails, allow you to build intelligent applications that are interactive (e.g. Basecamp)
* Rails can also serve static content (e.g. static HTML pages, images, etc.)
* We will use our Ruby knowledge to write Rails applications

---

# Background on Rails

* Rails is an MVC framework
* Rails was first released by DHH in 2004
* Rails has gained lots of popularity as an easy-to-use framework for prototyping apps
* Rails is one of the best frameworks for testing & TDD
* Rails has evolved a lot over the past decade and made it incredibly easy to do many of the common web app goals (e.g. building APIs, forms, mail, etc.)

#### The Rails Mantra:

__Convention over Configuration__

---
# Installing Rails

```
$ gem install rails -v 4.1.1
$ rails -v
```

---
# Create An App

```
$ rails new movies
```

This creates a new folder called 'movies', and puts all the files Rails needs to run inside it.

---
# Explore The App Structure

```
$ cd movies
$ ls
```
---
# Open the app in your editor

```
$ cd movies
$ sublime .
```
---
# Start the server!

```
$ rails server # shortcut: rails s
```
---
## Rails is alive!

* Once the server is running, you can access it at ```localhost:3000```
* The default *port* that it runs on is 3000
* By default, it shows the simple landing index page

---
## Using Rails as a Static Server

* Try modifying the index page to be different
* Try adding your own pages and accessing them (static .HTML files)
* Try adding images to /public/ and accessing them

---

# The Next Level

Now, we want to go the next step and start building __dynamic__ web applications.

---

## What is a dynamic web application?

* Dynamic web applications are different from static web sites in that they __change__ and respond based on user interactions. Pretty much any interactive web site you have visited is almost surely powered by a dynamic web application server (e.g. Google, Gmail, Netflix, Twitter).

* These apps listen to your requests (a Google search, a Netflix movie lookup) and respond accordingly. We will be building applications that __respond to requests__ made by users.

---

# Using Rails
## for dynamic web applications

Rails is known for its incredibly ease of use when it comes to prototyping web applications. 

One of the primary reasons for its popularity is the ability to get a working, interactive app up & running extremely quickly. Initially, we will be leveraging some of these 'starter' tools that Rails provides, until we move on to more advanced techniques.

---

## Rails Scaffolding

Scaffolds automatically give us the basic functionality for creating, deleting, and editing simple __resources__ in our application. This is also known as "CRUD".

---

# Resources

__Resource__ is a term typically used to describe a fundamental business entity in the application. In general, anything you want to __store__ in your application will likely be considered a resource that you can model in your application.

---

## Simple Examples of Resources

__Users__ are also resources in almost every single application.

* For Amazon: Products
* For Netflix: Movies
* For Twitter: Tweets

---

# Scaffolding

```
$ rails generate scaffold Movie title:string year:string
```

---

# Run the server again

* If you now hit the server again, you get a 'ActiveRecord::PendingMigrationError' error. This means that your migrations have not run yet.
* Migrations are mechanisms for making changes to the database. We won't try to fully understand this yet, but we'll fix it...

---
# Run migrations

```
$ rake db:migrate
```
---
# Voila

Navigate to localhost:3000/movies to see your scaffolded Movies functionality.

Congratulations! You've built your first Rails app. Take a breath, and rejoice!

---

## Scaffolding FTW

Within seconds, Rails scaffolding provided us with a pretty incredible set of barebones functionality. This is a great start. 

We won't be using Scaffolding for much longer, but it's a good way to hit the ground running when you're just getting started.
