# INTRO TO RAILS
### Building a Simple Twitter app

Today we'll be building out a simple Twitter application that displays some tweets for a given Twitter user.

### TWITTER (PART ONE)

# Migrations

* Migrations are Ruby scripts that tell your application how to make a set of changes to your database.
* Once you run a migration, those changes are applied to your development database. 
* Undo-ing a migration can be tricky, so make sure to double-check your migration script before running it.

# What is a Database?

* A database is a __store__ for all your application data
* A database has many *tables*, one for each unique type of data you have
* Tables map naturally to each of the application's __resources__

# What is a Rails View?

* A Rails view is a template that allows you to render HTML, but with some dynamic logic
* It's like an HTML file, except you can put Ruby logic in it to make it dynamic

# Twitter App is GO

Congrats! You've built a Twitter app... this app will be enhanced further in the next lecture.

To save our work, let's use Git and GitHub to store our application code.

# Git vs GitHub

- Git is a tool that you can use to track all *local* changes to your application files
- It is software on your computer that allows you to batch a set of changes you've made together into 'commits', undo changes, and much more
- GitHub is a *remote* repository that lets you store all your code in the cloud
- GitHub facilitates sharing your code with the world easily

# Final Project: Proposal

* The biggest goal of this program is the final project. 
* You should start thinking about what you want to build as your final project __immediately__. 
* We will provide more clarity around its exact requirements soon, but in the meantime, spend some time thinking about what kind of app you'd like to build, and what features it would have.
* There are no examples of 'past projects'. You are the pioneers here. Set the standard for all those to come.
