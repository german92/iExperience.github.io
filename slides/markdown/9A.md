# From the ground up

---

Last lecture, we used **GET** and **POST** requests to change what types of Reddit items we could see.

---

Today, we'll actually be *creating*, *reading*, *updating* and *deleting* resources with our Twitter applicationâ€”that is, it'll work!  
  
We're going to start from scratch.

---

# Code Along

As we finish all the resources, and fully understand what scaffolding gave us.

NOTE: Create new repo.

---

# So what did we learn?

How to create, display (read), update and delete data.  

### CRUD!

---

# The development steps

---

# 1. Think about the behavior of your app

- What should users be able to do?
- What should they *not* be able to do?
- What models do I need to store that data?
- What actions do those models need?

---

# 2. Generate models

```bash
$ rails g model Tweet body:string
$ rails g model User handle:string email:string bio:text
```
  
Make sure to also set up relationships between models

---

# 3. Generate controllers

```bash
$ rails g controller tweets index create new delete
$ rails g controller users create new update edit delete
```

---

# 4. Hook up routes

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

get 'profile' => 'users#read'
post 'tweets' => 'tweets#create'
delete 'tweets/:id' => 'tweets#delete'
root 'tweets#index'
```

---

# 5. Populate controllers with data

```ruby
# app/controllers/tweets_controller.rb

def index
  @tweets = Tweet.order('created_at DESC')
end
```

---

# 6. Write model methods as necessary

```ruby
# app/controllers/tweet.rb

belongs_to :user
```

(We didn't need to write any except relations)

---

# 7. Render your data in views

This is the designer's chance to show off some CSS skills!

---

# 8. Rinse and repeat

You won't necessarily go through all steps 1-7 each time
