# Visualizing MVC

---

# Forget about Rails for a sec...

And let's start a business 

---

# A GALLERY!

---

# STEP 1: BUILD THE BUILDING

---

# STEP 2: DECORATE

---

# STEP 3: LEAVE

Let people come by, enjoy the art, hang out

---

# Getting Some window shoppers, but...

Now we want a *custom* shopper experience

---

# STEP 3 (revised):
# HIRE A THINKING PERSON

Make sales, guide customers, *remember* customers

---

# LIFE OF A SALES REP

- Greet customer, be friendly
- Find out what he/she wants
- Show them the right art
- Make the sale

---

# AGAIN AND AGAIN

As your business grows, your sales rep will get tired

---

# HIRE MORE!

Now each one greets, interacts, shows art, and sells

---

# BUSINESS IS BUMPIN'

It's getting hard for your sales reps to remember what works of art you have...

---

# INVENTORY

Nice.


---

# LIFE OF A SALES REP
# (FOR A BUMPIN' BUSINESS)

- Greet customer, be friendly
- Find out what he/she wants
- Check inventory for what he/she might like
- Show them art
- Make the sale

---

# IS THIS EFFICIENT?

Probably not. We want some kind of **division of labor**.

---

# DIVIDE AND CONQUER

- A greeter
- A shower
- An inventory-checker
- A checkout rep

---

# DOES THIS SOUND FAMILIAR?

Hint: yes.

---

# WE JUST BUILT RAILS

---

# STEP 1: BUILD THE BUILDING

Your **HTML**

---

# STEP 2: DECORATE

Your **CSS**

---

# STEP 3: LEAVE

Now you have a *static site*.  
People can come and look around, but can't *interact*.

---

# STEP 3 (revised):
# HIRE A THINKING PERSON

- This is the start of your *app*. 
- The structure of your store depends on your design *framework*.
  - Rails is one option, but others work differently

---

# INVENTORY

Database.

---

# THE FRAMEWORK

Notice that as we grew, we needed certain things, like  

- An inventory
- Division of labor

---

# THE FRAMEWORK

As we grow even more, we'll need more and more things

- Loyalty points
- Coupons
- Etc.

---

# THE FRAMEWORK

If your framework is good, its easy to add new features  
**Rails is good** for this reason.

---

# DIVIDED AND CONQUERED

A greeter  

**The routes**

NOTE: Explain that it's the "gate" to your application: tells shoppers where to go if they want to certain things like buy certain kinds of art, return, etc.

---

# DIVIDED AND CONQUERED

A shower  

**The controller**

NOTE: Processes your "inputs" (what you want to see, how much you want to spend, basically *parameters*). Communicates with the inventory checker, and sends you to the checkout rep.

--- 

# DIVIDED AND CONQUERED

An inventory checker  

**The model**

NOTE: Checks inventory. THE CHECKERS IS NOT THE SAME AS THE INVENTORYâ€”this is the difference between the model and the database. The model is a specialized thing that communicates efficiently with the database. 

---

# DIVIDED AND CONQUERED

A checkout rep  

**The view**

NOTE: Something that takes the work of the inventory checker and shower, packages it nicely (even giftwraps maybe) and sends you on your way.


---

# ROUTES + MVC

- Greeter
- Shower
- Inventory checker
- Checkout rep

---

# CONTINUING THE ANALOGY

---

# MORE CONTROLLERS

Like having different departments in your gallery

---

# CONTROLLER ACTIONS

In each department, you can do different things

- In the Rare Pieces department, you can look but you can't touch
- In the Children Artwork department, you can look, touch, and create
- Etc.

---

# DATABASE TABLES

- As you grow, you'll have many inventory checkers. 
- It would be nice if the Rare Pieces inventory checker didn't have to sift through Children Artwork.  
- **Database tables compartmentalize data**
