# REQUEST PARAMS

---
# Code-Along Cont'd

Let's continue the Reddit Rails code-along to improve the way we fetch and stored stories. Also, let's allow the user to customize the view by various filters.

NOTE:
- Demonstrate query params to get the top/hot/search
- update the code to add an ID param and only save new ones

---
# Request Parameters

We can read the parameters from the URL and use them to change the behavior in our application.
<br/><br/>
These parameters are known as __querystring parameters__.

---
# Reading Request Params

For the URL: http://site.com/home?q=hello&limit=5

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
	def some_action
		params[:q]
		# => hello

		params[:limit]
		# => 5
	end
end
```

# Request Methods

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

---
### Declaring HTTP Methods in Routes

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
	# this will capture a GET request 
	# and will hit the StoriesController, index method
	get 'stories' => 'stories#index'

	# this will capture a POST request
	# and will send to the StoriesController, filter method
	post 'stories' => 'stories#filter'

	# ... similar methods exist for DELETE, PUT ...
end
```
