# REQUEST PARAMS

# Code-Along Cont'd

Let's continue the Reddit Rails code-along to improve the way we fetch and stored stories. Also, let's allow the user to customize the view by various filters.

[Find the code on Github](https://github.com/iExperience/reddit_rails/tree/43623ccd642ebd8d687c80f107603602bc2b3198)

NOTE:
- Demonstrate query params to get the top/hot/search
- update the code to add an ID param and only save new ones

# Request Methods

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

---
# GET vs POST

* GET and POST are the most commonly used methods
* GET is used to GET information, and is used by your browser every time you enter a URL and hit enter
* POST is used to POST information, such as when you are creating a new resource
* GET does not pass much data (except a few parameters in the querystring)
* POST often passes a lot of data (such as the entire set of attributes for a new resource)

---

# Request Parameters

We can read the parameters from the URL and use them to change the behavior in our application.
<br/><br/>
These parameters are known as __querystring parameters__.

---
# Reading Request Params

For the URL: http://site.com/home?q=hello&limit=5

```ruby
class SomeController < ApplicationController
	def some_action
		params[:q]
		# => hello

		params[:limit]
		# => 5
	end
end
```

### Declaring HTTP Methods in Routes

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
	# this will capture a GET request 
	# and will hit the StoriesController, index method
	get 'stories' => 'stories#index'

	# this will capture a POST request
	# and will send to the StoriesController, filter method
	post 'stories' => 'stories#filter'

	# ... similar methods exist for DELETE, PUT ...
end
```

# RECAP

* We learned that different kinds of requests used different __HTTP methods__ such as GET, POST, etc. for different purposes
* We learned how to read __querystring parameters__ from the URL into our ```params``` hash in Rails actions
* We learned that browser requests always use a GET method
* We learned that form submissions use a POST method by default
