# What is testing?

* In application development, Testing is the practice of writing code to test your code
* The Ruby Koans exercises we did are a very simple form of testing
* Essentially, you write scripts which call certain parts of your code, set expectations about what should happen, and then verify the results

---

# Why is testing important?

* Testing manually ("by hand") is unreliable and inefficient
* Making code changes without tests has a high risk of breaking other functionality
* Testing provides us with a __contract__ that we can rely on
* A solid test suite gives you the __freedom__ to refactor regularly
* Ultimately, testing makes development more enjoyable, and makes you __happier__

---

# Is testing hard?

* Initially, yes... but you get out what you give in
* Testing is a __team sport__
* Testing requires a shift in mindset
* It's tough to start testing in an untested codebase

---

# THE BRIGHT SIDE

* The Ruby/Rails dev community is one of the strongest advocates of testing and TDD
* The tools provided for testing in Rails are extremely powerful and easy to use
* If you are working in the Rails community, you will find lots of support from peers

# What is TDD?

* TDD: Test-Driven Development
* Within the broad spectrum of testing, TDD is a certain practice of testing where you:

  1. [RED] Write a test for functionality that doesn't exist (and see the test fail)
  2. [GREEN] Write only the code necessary to make the test pass (and see the test pass)
  3. [REFACTOR] to improve quality where possible (and ensure the test stays passing)
