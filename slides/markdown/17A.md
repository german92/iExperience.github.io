# Testing

# What is testing?

* In application development, Testing is the practice of writing code to test your code
* The Ruby Koans exercises we did are a very simple form of testing
* Essentially, you write scripts which call certain parts of your code, set expectations about what should happen, and then verify the results

---

# Why is testing important?

* Testing manually ("by hand") is unreliable and inefficient
* Making code changes without tests has a high risk of breaking other functionality
* Testing provides us with a __contract__ that we can rely on
* A solid test suite gives you the __freedom__ to refactor regularly
* Ultimately, testing makes development more enjoyable, and makes you __happier__

---

# Is testing hard?

* Initially, yes... but you get out what you give in
* Testing is a __team sport__
* Testing requires a shift in mindset
* It's tough to start testing in an untested codebase

---

# THE BRIGHT SIDE

* The Ruby/Rails dev community is one of the strongest advocates of testing and TDD
* The tools provided for testing in Rails are extremely powerful and easy to use
* If you are working in the Rails community, you will find lots of support from peers

---

# What is TDD?

* TDD: Test-Driven Development
* Within the broad spectrum of testing, TDD is a certain practice of testing where you:

  1. [RED] Write a test for functionality that doesn't exist (and see the test fail)
  2. [GREEN] Write only the code necessary to make the test pass (and see the test pass)
  3. [REFACTOR] to improve quality where possible (and ensure the test stays passing)

# Major Types of Tests
### In Rails Testing

1. Acceptance Test (Top Level User Stories)
2. Controller Test
3. Model Tests

---

Views are not tested.

---

In order to succeed at TDD, you need to develop against clear, detailed __user stories__ that will define your __acceptance tests__.

---
# Sample User Story

<div style="text-align:left">
As a user,<br/>
When I am on the TV show list page,<br/>
And I click on the "New" button,<br/>
Then I should be redirected to a "New Show" page<br/>
<br/>
When I fill in the text box for "Title" with a valid title,<br/>
And I fill in the text box for "Description" with a valid description,<br/>
And I click "Submit",<br/>
Then I should see a success message "Your TV show was created successfully"<br/>
And I should be taken to the TV show list page,<br/>
And I should see the new show in the list<br/>
</div>

# Code-Along: 
## TDD with Twitter

Let's write some acceptance tests for a few features in the Twitter app.
