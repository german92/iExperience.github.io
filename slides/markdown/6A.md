# Review: Scaffolding

```
$ rails new twitter
$ cd twitter
$ rails generate scaffold Tweet body:string handle:string
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails s
```

# Review: Views

* Rails views are like advanced HTML files
* You can write any (valid) HTML you wish to use, but you can also use Ruby to generate HTML code dynamically (e.g. with loops)
* Standard Rails views end with the ```.html.erb``` extension instead
* The .erb stands for 'evaluated Ruby'. This means they can have both HTML and Ruby inside them

---

## Review: View Helper Methods

* Views have access to special helper methods, that are only accessible inside views
* Examples include ```link_to```, ```image_tag```
* These are simple methods (like ```puts```), but they are designed only for Rails views, and usually used to generate HTML tags
* You can write your own Helper Methods for Rails views to simplify your Ruby code inside views.

---

# Layouts

* Layouts are html.erb files that serve as a wrapper for all rendered pages
* You can place content that is common to all pages in them, such as HTML and HEAD tags, as well as headers and footers for your web site layout.
* Rails apps ship with a default layout, found in ```layouts/application.html.erb```

# Code-Along

Let's update our Twitter app to use the application layout for a header and footer.

## Views: Common Helper Methods

* ```image_tag``` (generate an ```img``` tag)
* ```link_to``` (generate an ```a``` tag)
* ```mail_to``` (generate an ```a```
 tag to send email)

## Creating a new Resource
### with ```form_for```

* ```form_for``` is a Rails view helper tag to help easily generate forms
* It takes as an *argument* the instance variable for the resource you are creating or editing
* It gives you a "form variable", which you can then invoke all the form methods on to easily generate form fields

# Code-Along

Let's scaffold a User resource with additional fields.

# Partials

* Partials are "small views" that are shared between multiple views
* They end in .html.erb just like views, but they begin with _ (e.g. _form.html.erb)
* Partials can be __included__ into another view by using the command ```render :partial => 'form'```. The extension of the file is optional.
* Even shorter syntax for partials: ```render 'form'```. This assumes the file is in the same folder as the View that is including it.

---
# RECAP

* We can use view helpers to generate HTML tags
* We can use layouts to reuse code across all pages
* We can use forms to generate forms and form fields
* We can use partials to share view code between views
