# Customizing Devise

---

# Before filters

Code that is run **before** each action in a controller

---

### Before filters

```ruby
class GroupsController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authenticate_user!

  def index
    ...
  end

  ...
end
```
---

### Before filters

```ruby
class GroupsController < ApplicationController
  before_filter :authenticate_user!, only: [:create, :update]
  ...

end
```

---

# Resourceful routes

Remember, scaffolding generated all our routes in one command with `resources :users`.

---

# We can do the same

But only generate some of the routes

```ruby
resources :users, only: [:create, :edit, :update, :destroy]
```
  
OR  

```ruby
resources :users, except: [:index, :new, :show]
```

--- 

# Flash

Before, we were using the `flash` hash.

---

# Flash in Rails 4

Just use `notice` and `alert`.
