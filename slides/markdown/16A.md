# Deploying Apps to the Web

---
# Takin it Live

The final step for our applications is to deploy them to the web, so they are publicly accessible on the internet.
<br/><br/>
We will use a service called Heroku to host our app on the web.

---

# What is Heroku?

* Heroku is a cloud hosting service for Rails (and other) applications
* It is free to deploy your app to Heroku, with some limitations
* Heroku has a simple set of tools (Heroku Toolbelt) which make deploying to it as easy as deploying your code to GitHub
* When we 'push' to Heroku, we get a new website domain which points to a hosted instance of our Rails application.

---

# Why deploy to Heroku?

* While it's nice to see our application locally, the primary value of an app is when it is shared with the world
* Heroku is the quickest and simplest way to share a prototype web application with the world
* Heroku is free*, and awesome!

# Rails Environment
### Development vs Production

* When we run our app __locally__ on our machine, it uses the __development__ mode
* When we run our app __externally__ on Heroku, it will use the __production__ environment
* The term 'production' is used to refer to the 'live' environment where all of our users would be able to access our site
* There is also another environment, staging, which is used by development teams as an intermediate step between development and production (primarily used for testing purposes)

# Code-Along: Deploying to Heroku

Follow the [Heroku Quickstart Guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/quickstart)

# Major Steps

1. Add 'pg' gem for production mode
2. Add 'rails_12factor' gem for production mode
3. Add postgres production config to config/database.yml
4. ```git push heroku master```
5. ```heroku run rake db:migrate```
6. ```heroku ps:scale web=1```

---
# How do I visit my live app?

```$ heroku open```

---
# Congrats!

You've just deployed your first Rails application to the internet! It's LIVE!

# How do I run Rails console on Heroku?

```$ heroku run console```

---
# Do I still need to push to GitHub?

```
$ git push origin master # push (local) master to GitHub
$ git push heroku master # push (local) master to Heroku
```

* YES!
* GitHub is still your code repository, you should still push there frequently to store and share your code.
* Heroku is your live app deployment, you should only push there when you want to release a new set of changes to your users.

---
# How should I adjust my development flow?

* Write, run and test your code locally, and push to GitHub as per normal
* Every so often, when you feel a new major feature (or set of features) is complete, push to Heroku
* Use Heroku as a display case for your app, not a testing ground
* Only deploy to Heroku when you feel a new feature is truly __finished__

# Wait! What does this warning mean?

# Refresher: Databases

* A database is what stores all the data for our application
* There are many different implementations of relational databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others
* All of these standard databases are communicated with using SQL
* While they all speak SQL, the way they store and access their data is different for each implementation

---

# The Problem

* Our Rails app uses the SQLite database, because it is light and simple
* Heroku does _not_ support SQLite, because it can't work on Heroku environments (more info: [SQLite on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/sqlite3))
* Heroku only supports the PostgreSQL database

---
# Do we have to use Postgres to use Heroku?

* It's not absolutely required, but it's bad practice to use SQLite locally on our __development__ app with PostgreSQL on our __production__ app
* In general, using a different database for development vs production mode causes problems (more info: [Parity Between Deployment](http://12factor.net/dev-prod-parity))
* To follow best practices, we should install PostgreSQL locally so that we use PostgreSQL on development and production modes

---
# How do we install Postgres locally?

* For Mac, use the wonderful [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/), and follow the [documentation](http://postgresapp.com/documentation/)
* For Windows, try the following [PostgreSQL Guide](http://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/)

---
# Steps: Using Postgres for Development Mode

1. Update your Gemfile to remove 'sqlite3' gem
2. Set the 'pg' gem to bundle on all environments
3. Update the database.yml to use postgres for all environments
4. ```bundle```

---
# How do I test my local app?

* The same way you always do, except you need to ensure PostgreSQL is always running for your app to work
* Run your local Rails server and verify it is still available on localhost:3000
* You will need to run ```rake db:migrate``` again to create all your tables on the new PostgreSQL local database
* WARNING: As a result, all previous local data will be lost

# EXERCISES

1. Take your final project application and deploy it to Heroku.
2. BONUS: Install PostgreSQL locally and use it in development mode.
