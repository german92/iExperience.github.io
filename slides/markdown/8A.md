# Relationships?

* Kind of, but call them *relations*
* A way to relate two classes
* Example: a User has many Tweets
* Example: every Tweet belongs to a User

---

# But why?

* Often, when we want to know things about related models
* Example: Show who a particular tweet came from
* Example: Show all of a user's tweets
* Example: Show all of a tweet's hash tags

---

# Many kinds of relations

We'll go through them one by one

---

# One to one

* A User *has one* Account
* An Account *belongs to* a User
* A *one to one* relation

---

# One to many

* A User *has many* Tweets
* A Tweet *belongs to* a User
* A *one to many* relation

---

# Many to many

* A Tweet *has many* HashTags
* A HashTag *belongs to many* Tweets
* A *many to many* relation

---

# Many to many 

* We might also say:
  * A HashTag *has many* Tweets
  * A Tweet *belongs to many* HashTags
* In the many to many case, the terminology is reversable
  * This is **not true** for the others!

---

# Has and belongs to many

* We might even say a Tweet *has and belongs to many* HashTags
* And HashTag *has and belongs to many* Tweets

---

# Many to one?

Same as one to many

---

# Visualizing relations

NOTE: Use the board. Start by drawing out one-to-one, then one-to-many, then many-to-many. Use arrows and boxes, as you might actually visualize when building an application

# Cool! How do they work in the database?

# Hold up: Through

Sometimes, you want to specify that a model has many of A, but *as a result* of having some of B.

* A Shopper has one Cart
* A Cart has many Items
* Therefore, a Shopper has many Items, *through* Cart

NOTE: Do some more boardwork here

# But...so what?

After setting this up, Rails gives you many methods for free

### Using Relations (belongs_to & has_many)

```ruby
> user = User.new(:name => "Salman").save
> user.tweets
# => []

> tweet = Tweet.new(:body => "Hey!").save
> user.tweets << tweet
> user.tweets
# => [<#Tweet id:1 body:"Hey!">]

> tweet.user
# => <#User id:1 name:"Salman">
```

---

# Let's use them!
     
     
Code along, children, as we build Twitter yet again

NOTE: Back to Twitter. Give tweet.rb a belongs_to, and show how to use t.belongs_to in database migration by adding a new migration. Play around in the console to show how the user_id column has shown up. Then give user.rb a has_many and ask, do we need anything in the database?

---
# Code-Along Steps

1. Add the columns needed via migrations (add user_id to tweets)
2. Run migrations
3. Add the ```belongs_to :user``` call to Tweet model
4. Add a new select dropdown in the tweets/new view to pick the user
5. Update the permit call at the bottom of tweets_controller to accept :user_id, and remove :handle
6. Show the tweet.user.handle in the tweets/index page
7. Remove the old handle printing from the tweets/index page
8. Remove the old ```handle``` column from tweets table (via migration)
