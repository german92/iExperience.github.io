# REVIEW

* We learned that Strings, Integers, Arrays, etc. are all Objects
* The __objects__ we work with are __instances__ of a Class
* Depending on what __class__ an object is, it has different methods you can call on it
* We can define methods using ```def foo ... end```
* Methods are primarily used to DRY up your code
* The last line (statement) of a method is the return value
* Only local variables declared __within__ a method are accessible inside the method
* We learned how to make API calls using RestClient

# Defining Classes

---
# Why Define Classes?

* To group behavior (methods) that are related (i.e. they operate on similar data or do similar work)
* To group data (variables) that are related (e.g. different attributes of a Person)

---
# What's wrong with just using methods?

* Object-Oriented Programming dictates that we should encapsulate data and behavior inside relevant objects, so that concerns are separated appropriately
* An object should know how to store and change its own data. The whole world does not need to know how to work with an object's inner details.

---

# Employees Example

```ruby
salman = {:age => 29, :first_name => 'Salman', :last_name => 'Ansari'}

def get_full_name(person)
	"#{person[:first_name]} {person[:last_name]}"
end

get_full_name(salman)
```
It is cumbersome to have to pass around ```person``` everytime you want to get their full name. There must be a better way...

---
# Defining Your Own Classes

You can define a new type of Class (e.g. Employee) very easily in Ruby. Once you do so, you can define exactly what data an __instance__ of your Class would contain (e.g. first_name, last_name, full_name, etc.)
<br/><br/>
Also, you can define you own methods within the class, known as __instance methods__.

---

### Employees Example Revisited

```ruby
class Employee
	def initialize(age, first_name, last_name)
		@age = age # this is an instance variable
		@first_name = first_name
		@last_name = last_name
	end

	def age
		@age
	end

	def full_name
		"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
	end
end

# ...
```

--


```ruby
salman = Employee.new(29, 'Salman', 'Ansari')

salman.age
# => 29

salman.full_name
# => 'Salman Ansari'
```

---

# Classes Store Data
## using instance variables

* An instance of a class stores data using __instance variables__
* Instance variables are denoted with an @ (vs. local variables which do not have any special denotation)
* Instance variables live as long as the object instance lives
* Instance variables are shared between methods within the instance

---

# Instance Variable Scope

Instance variables are shared across all methods within a Class.

```ruby
class Person
	def initialize(age, sex, location)
		@age = age
		@sex = sex
		@location = location
	end

	def a_s_l
		"#{@age} / #{@sex} / #{@location}"
	end
end
```

---

# Key Concepts

* Declare a class with methods:
```ruby
class MyClass
	... # contains `initialize` method, among others
end
```
* Instantiate an instance of a Class with:
```ruby
my_class = MyClass.new
```
* Call methods on the instance just like with Array/String/etc
```ruby
my_class.my_method
```
* Use classes to encapsulate shared __behavior and data__

---
# Encapsulating Behavior

If you have a bunch of methods that are related to each other, they probably belong inside a single __Class__.

---
# Encapsulating Data

If you have a bunch of data (e.g. info about a Person) that is related, it probably belongs together inside a Class __instance__.

---

### Multiple Classes

```ruby
class Engineer
	def initialize(age, first_name, last_name)
		@age = age
		@first_name = first_name
		@last_name = last_name
	end

	def full_name
		"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
	end
end

salman = Engineer.new(20, 'Salman', 'Ansari')

# Cont'd below...
```

--

```ruby
class Designer
	def initialize(age, first_name, last_name, website)
		@age = age
		@first_name = first_name
		@last_name = last_name
		@website = website
	end

	def full_name
		"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
	end
end

aaron = Designer.new(20, 'Aaron', 'Fuchs', 'iexperience.co.za')

```
---
### Class Inheritance

* You can use class inheritance to share methods between classes, if they are duplicated
* You can have as many classes as you want inheriting from a parent class
* Class inheritance is achieved through the class declaration (```class Child < Parent ... end```)

---
### Sharing Methods via Class Inheritance
```ruby
class Employee
	def full_name
		"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
	end
end

class Engineer < Employee
	def initialize(age, first_name, last_name)
		@age = age
		@first_name = first_name
		@last_name = last_name
	end
end

# Cont'd below...
```

--

```ruby
class Designer < Employee
	def initialize(age, first_name, last_name, website)
		@age = age
		@first_name = first_name
		@last_name = last_name
		@website = website
	end
end
```
---

As the number of classes declared increases, we will want to separate out each Ruby Class declaration into its own file

---
```ruby
# in employee.rb
class Employee
	...
end
# in engineer.rb
class Engineer
	...
end
# in designer.rb
class Designer
	...
end

# in main.rb
require_relative 'employee'
require_relative 'engineer'
require_relative 'designer'

salman = Engineer.new(20, 'Salman', 'Ansari')
aaron = Designer.new(20, 'Aaron', 'Fuchs', 'http://www.iexperience.co.za')
```
---

While we are just working with Ruby, a good practice is to have a single ```main.rb``` file with your entire program in it, which requires any other classes it needs in order to function using ```require_relative```

# Identity Crisis

How does an object know what kind of Class it is?

---

# What am I?

```ruby
>> [1,2,3].class
=> Array

>> ([1,2,3].class == Array)
=> true

>> [1,2,3].is_a?(Array)
=> true

>> [1,2,3].is_a?(Object)
=> true

>> [1,2,3].instance_of?(Array)
=> true

>> [1,2,3].instance_of?(Object)
=> false
```

# The Animal Analogy

Imagine we had Classes to categories animals on this planet.

```ruby
cat = Cat.new

cat.instance_of?(Cat)
# => true

cat.instance_of?(Dog)
# => false

cat.is_a?(Dog)
# => false

cat.is_a?(Animal)
# => true

cat.instance_of?(Animal)
# => false
```

![Animal Class Heirarchy](/images/slides/4A/animal-class-heirarchy.jpg)

---
# is_a? vs instance_of?

The ```is_a?``` method checks if the object is an instance of the given class, OR if the given class is a parent class of its class.
<br/><br/>
The ```instance_of?``` method only returns true if the object is an instance of the given class.

---
# A Family of Methods

An object inherits methods not just from its parent class, but from its entire __ancestry__ of classes.

---

Q. How can we tell if an Object supports a particular method?
A. ```respond_to?```

```ruby
>> [1,2,3].respond_to?(:size)
=> true

>> [1,2,3].respond_to?(:keys)
=> false

>> {:jersey => 23}.respond_to?(:keys)
=> true
```

---

In Ruby, we pass around Objects without specifying what type/class they are in method arguments.
<br/><br/>
Ultimately, we only care whether an object __responds__ to a particular method, rather than worrying about what __Class__ it is.

---
# Ruby Duck Typing

"I don't really care if the argument is an Array or not, I just want it to respond to .size, .push, and .max."
<br/><br/>
"If it quacks like a duck... it's a duck."

---
# Ruby != Classist

<br/>
It doesn't matter what I am (```Class```). 
<br/><br/>
It only matters what I can do (```respond_to```).

---

---
# MOAR Methods!
<br/>
You might wish your object could get methods from more than one class.
<br/><br/>
For example, if you were Mario, you might want methods from the ```FireMario``` class as well as the ```IceMario``` class.
<br/><br/>
Unfortunately, that isn't possible. You can only inherit from one class at a time.

---

If you want to inherit methods from multiple places, instead of using classes, you can use __Modules__.

---

# What is a Module?

* A module allows you to define a set of methods in one place
* Classes can then __include__ that Module to get all its methods
* However, you cannot create an instance of a Module; there is no such thing as a Module instance
* Modules are used as simple ways to put a bunch of methods in one place so that many different classes can __include__ them

---

```ruby
module HelpfulStuff
	def full_name
		"#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
	end
	def initials
		"#{@first_name[0]}#{@last_name[0]}"
	end
end
class Employee
	include HelpfulStuff
end

salman = Employee.new(20, 'Salman', 'Ansari')
salman.full_name
# => Salman Ansari
salman.initials
# => SA
```
---
## Why should we care about Modules?

Rails uses Modules extensively to provide various functionality. You will see them used often in your Rails apps.

---

# Summary

* We can define our own classes with custom methods
* We can instantiate classes and call methods on those object instances
* We can use instances of classes to store data (through instance variables)
* We can use class inheritance to share methods between classes
* We can define Modules and include them in classes to get their methods
