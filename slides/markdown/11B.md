# Review: One to many relation

- A user has many tweets
- A tweet belongs to a user  
  

The `user_id` is stored in the tweet.

# Many to Many relation

- A user has many groups
- A group has many users  
- A user *has and belongs to many* groups
- A group *has and belongs to many* users

Where should we store the ids?

# Join table

A join table is an *intermediary* table between two models.  
It contains only the ids of the two models.  

<table style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;" class="reveal">
<tr>
  <th>`user_id`</th>
  <th>`group_id`</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

- Group 2: User 1
- Group 3: Users 1 & 3

<table style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;" class="reveal">
<tr>
  <th>`user_id`</th>
  <th>`group_id`</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
