# Many to Many, Join Tables, Seeds

---

# Review: One to many relation

- A user has many tweets
- A tweet belongs to a user  
  

The `user_id` is stored in the tweet.

---

# Many to Many relation

- A user has many groups
- A group has many users  
- A user *has and belongs to many* groups
- A group *has and belongs to many* users

Where should we store the ids?

# Join table

A join table is an *intermediary* table between two models.  
It contains only the ids of the two models.  

<table style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;" class="reveal">
<tr>
  <th>`user_id`</th>
  <th>`group_id`</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

# Join Table

- Group 1: Users 1 & 2
- Group 2: User 1
- Group 3: Users 1 & 3

<table style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px;" class="reveal">
<tr>
  <th>`user_id`</th>
  <th>`group_id`</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>1</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>3</td>
  <td>3</td>
</tr>
</table>

NOTE: Do some boardwork to explain the methods and what is happening in the database when user.groups << Group.new and group.users << User.new

# Codealong: Groupme

[Code on Github](https://github.com/iExperience/groupme/tree/2b05a48fcd1ce1667f08edc7f84a723963f803a6)


NOTE: Create a User model with devise, create a Group class, create a join table, and show all the user's logged in groups. Use the db/seeds.rb file to generate test data. This is as much about reviewing User authentication as it is about many-to-many relationships. Eventually, we'll add User pictures as well.

---

# SEEDS

A place to put your test data, instead of typing it into the `rails console`.   
Run with `rake db:seed`.
