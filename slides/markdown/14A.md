# Javascript & jQuery

Let's work through some online resources on Javascript and jQuery to familiarize ourselves with the language.

# Use the Developer Console
## to test out javascript

# Declaring variables

```javascript
> var x = "Hello";
  undefined
> x
  "Hello"
```
---
# Declaring functions

```javascript
> function shout(msg) { alert(msg); }
  undefined
> shout('Hey')
// a browser popup alert is shown
```

---
# Printing to console

```javascript
> console.log('hey')
  hey
  undefined
```
---
# Passing functions as arguments

```javascript
> function get(url, data, onSuccess) { onSuccess(); }
  undefined
> get('www.place.com', {"q": "test"}, function() { alert('hey'); });
  // popup alert with 'hey' is shown
```

# Playing with jQuery

```javascript
$('#projects') // selects all elements with id='projects'
$('.item') // selects all elements with class='item'
$('#projects').html('No projects found.') // replaces the inner HTML
$('#message').show('fast') // animates showing element
$('#menu').slideDown() // animates down the element
```

# jQuery AJAX

Review the code used in the prodix and basecamp sample applications. Those apps utilize JS along with AJAX to build interactive functionality, and that code should now be more familiar and approachable.

# EXERCISES

Work through the CodeAcademy and jQuery guides, and ask us any questions you have as you go through. Use this time to get familiarized with JS syntax as much as possible.
