# TIPS ON SLIDES

* Less is more
* Bullets only, no paragraphs
* Picture-only or one-liner slides are best
* Use Presenter Notes & Presenter View
* Use bullet transitions
* Keep your slide designs simple

# THIS IS A BAD SLIDE

The main reason that people use online web applications is because they want to access the internet, which is a great resource for accessing information online and other resources such as encyclopedia information for various things.

The internet is now being used by 75% of the world or something like that, I am sure that if you looked it up you would actually be able to get some numbers that would verify it.

Honestly I'm not sure why you're still reading this slide, it's absurdly long and you should have run out of patience by now, but since you are, I thought I would tell you about my pet bird Joey Joe-Joe Junior Shabadoo. He's a great bird but he really likes crackers and I like crackers too so sometimes he eats my crackers. No one should be eating my crackers, I mean I bought them. It's not like the __bird__ bought them...the bird doesn't even work. Sometimes I feel like I work for the bird. I mean I work and then make money then feed him so really I work FOR that stupid bird. What am I doing with my life?
