# Search, AJAX and Pagination

---

## Searching

* As your application data grows, you will be working with larger and larger lists of data
* For example: product lists, tag lists, user lists
* You want to simplify navigation of the data for your users
* A good solution: Search

## How do we Search data?

* The simplest search operates in a single field (e.g. for products, searching by name)
* We want to do something similar to an ActiveRecord ```where('name = ?', 'something')```, but we don't want to restrict to *exact* matches only
* To facilitate this, SQL provides a special operator: ```LIKE```, which you can use to find similar matches
* You could use LIKE to match a search of 'us', to "Us", "USA", "prune", and so on

---

## How do we implement search?

1. (__VIEW__) We need to add a text field to take the search input
2. (__CONTROLLER__) We need to modify our controller actions to *handle* a search query from our form
3. (__MODEL__) We need to filter the data we display to only show matches from our query

---

## Code-Along: Prodix Search

Let's add a search box to filter the list of Projects we display on the Projects index page.

---

# Too many projects?

* Occasionally, even with Search in place, the number of matches is simply too many to display at once
* We can use __pagination__ to help the user navigate a reasonable amount of data at once

---

# How do we implement pagination?

* There are many ways to do so, but a very popular solution is to use the __will-paginate__ gem
* The gem handles much of the heavy lifting, and we only have to add a few declarations to get it to work

---

## Code-Along: Prodix Pagination

Let's add pagination to filter down the list of Projects displayed to the user.

## User Experience Enhancements

Now that we've added new functionality, there are a few things we could do to improve the UX:

* Make searches and page changes without cluttering URL
* Allow search / page changes to happen without refreshing the browser
* Update search results as you type

---
## Client-Side Programming
### With Javascript

* To improve interactivity as we intend, we have to use controls available in the browser
* We can use Javascript to write code that will handle user interactions, update the page HTML, and more

---
## What is Javascript?

* Javascript is a __client-side__ (vs server-side), scripted (vs compiled) programming language
* It is generally used to write code for web browsers
* We will learn more about the programming language itself in future lessons, but for now we will do some very basic JS to get what we need

---
## AJAX
### Using Javascript to make Requests

* We will use JS to make requests to our server instead of directly submitting forms (and thus refreshing page)
* AJAX is the commonly used technique to use JS to make requests to the browser

---

# Q. Why use Javascript and/or AJAX?

## A. User Experience (Mostly)

---

In general, we can use JS and AJAX to improve the responsiveness and interactivity of our apps. It helps us build more usable apps, but usually JS is not a requirement for functionality to work.

---

# More on AJAX

* AJAX: Asynchronous Javascript and XML
* Essentially, it is a protocol supported by browsers which allows you to make requests in the 'background' using JS
* The response is then served back to the JS, and it can update the HTML without refreshing the page
* This is a common paradigm used to build 'snappy' applications that feel more responsive

---

# Code-Along: Prodix AJAXified

Let's update the search form and pagination to use AJAX to update the page rather than refreshing the page.

---
# Looking Ahead

We've provided a sample application where you use the techniques from this lecture to add search, pagination, AJAX, and some nice styling to build a solid UI and UX.

Sample Projects App: [https://github.com/iExperience/basecamp](https://github.com/iExperience/basecamp)

---

# Next Steps

* Take your AJAX'd app and style it up!
* Try using AJAX to allow users to add Items in the Project show page without refreshing the page
