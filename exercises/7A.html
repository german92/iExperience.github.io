<h2>E1: Review</h2>
<p>
  Answer the questions below to recall some of the concepts learned in class today. Make sure you know the answers to each before moving on to the next exercises.
  <ol>
    <li>What does "fat model, skinny controller" mean, and what is its significance in Rails development?</li> 
    <li>Why do we use instance variables in controllers? That is, why is there an <code>@</code> in front of some of them?</li>
    <li>What series of steps take place in the MVC framework when a browser issues the URL <code>/users</code>? Draw a relationship diagram showing the MVC structure and how it interacts to render /users URL in a browser. Number the steps.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Most of your logic should go in your model files. You controllers should only call methods that have been defined in the model.</li>
    <li>So that those variables can be accessible in the view. The view cannot see local variables created in the controller.</li>
    <li>Draw a diagram, but the flow should look like: Client -> Routes -> UsersController -> User Model -> Database -> Back to User Model -> Back to UsersController -> User index view -> Back to Client (a total of 9 steps)</li>
  </ol>

<h2>E2: Learn to REST</h2> 
<p>
  Routes are mapped to actions in controllers. Suggest what routes each of these actions correspond to. (Use the tweet resource for reference data)
  
  <ul>
    <li>Index</li>
    <li>Show</li>
    <li>New</li>
    <li>Edit</li>
  </ul>
</p>
{% if page.answers_shown %}
<a class="hover-show pull-right">Hover for answer</a>
<div class="hover-hide">
  <ul>
    <li><code>/users</code></li>
    <li><code>/users/1</code> (or any numerical ID)</li>
    <li><code>/users/new</code></li>
    <li><code>/users/5/edit</code> (again, or any numerical ID)</li>
  </ul>

<h2>E3: Guess what? Reweet</h2>
<p>
  We previously created tweet tweet data, Now let's try writing controller logic to manipulate this tweet data.

  <ul>
    <li>Write a new method in the <code>TweetsController</code>, <code>piglatify_tweets</code> that updates all the tweets to be in Piglatin, but using <code>piglatinify_sentence</code> instead of just <code>piglatinify</code> like we did in class. Make a route, a controller method and a button in the view so that with a click of a button, the user can turn one of his/her tweets into piglatin.</li>
  </ul>
