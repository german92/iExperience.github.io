<h2>E1: Review</h2>
<p>
  Answer the questions below to recall some of the concepts learned in class today. Make sure you know the answers to each before moving on to the next exercises.
  <ul>
    <li>What does "fat model, skinny controller" mean and what is its significance in rails development? This is an important concept that most beginners fail to implement. </li>
    <li>What is the use of instance variables in controllers?</li>
    <li>What's a short cut to generating routes?</li>
    <li>What series of steps take place in the MVC framework when a browser issues the URL <code>/users</code>? Draw a relationship diagram showing the MVC structure and how it interacts to render /users URL in a browser. Number the steps. You can draw on paper but using a drawing tool is highly recommended. </li>
    <li>If you edit your data model, what rails command do you issue to reflect that change on the database? (Buzz question)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>E2: Learn to REST</h2> 
<p>
  Routes are mapped to actions in controllers. Suggest what routes each of these actions correspond to. (Use the tweet resource for reference data)
  
  <ul>
    <li>Index</li>
    <li>Show</li>
    <li>New</li>
    <li>Create</li>
    <li>Edit</li>
    <li>Update</li>
    <li>Destroy</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>E3: Guess what? Reweet</h2>
<p>
  We previously created tweet tweet data, Now let's try writing controller logic to manipulate this tweet data.

  <ul>
    <li>Make a new tweet</li>
    <li>Use the update method to update your tweet with id = 3. Change it's content.</li>
    <li>Delete a tweet and redirect to listing all the updated tweet</li>
    <li>Write a new method, <code>piglatify_tweet</code> that updates the Tweet to be in Piglatin. Make a route, a controller method and a button in the view so that with a click of a button, the user can turn one of his/her tweets into piglatin.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
