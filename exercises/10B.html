<h2>Final Project Proposal</h2>
<p>
  Now that you've had several days to think up your idea and create groups, you'll need to write a formal proposal that the teachers will approve. This is due <b>Monday after class</b>, so you'll have the break in the middle to finish up. The proposal is extensive, however, so it's best to start earlier.
</p>
<p>
  In your proposal (which may be written as a Google document or a markdown one), please address these points:
  <ol>
    <li>Name of the product. </li>
    <li>All the members in your group. </li>
    <li>In <b>one-two</b> sentences, what your product does and what problem it solves—it should be primarily a Ruby on Rails application. We want you to keep this short so you have practice succinctly stating your idea.</li>
    <li>A list of existing, similar products in the market and why your app is better.</li>
    <li>Create 3 personas as per our workshop.</li>
    <li>Create a scenario for each persona.</li>
    <li>A features section that has the <b>minimum</b> number of features for the personas to reach their goals. The idea is to describe your <b>minimum viable product</b>.</li>
    <li>A design section that has mockups/sketches of <b>all</b> the pages of your website and how they might look. These should describe the user flow through your app from first visit to final goal.</li>
    <li>A dependencies section that details any gems, APIs or other dependencies your product will need. </li>
    <li>This will be a long one: A code section that briefly outlines all the features you'll actually code, and any problems you can foresee. Then, go through what we did in class on the whiteboard by making models, describing their attributes and relations, and creating logical controller actions for each model. Drawings might help for this section as well. </li>
    <li>A timeline, with dates, of when you plan to have each feature done. Remember to plan to be finished a couple of days before you have to present (that is, by Tuesday the 17th)—you can bet on having errors! Try to focus on one feature per day. Also leave some time to rehearse your presentation.</li>
    <li>How the features/designs/tasks will be split up amongst the members of your group. You may assign each feature to a person, or split it up another way. While coding in pairs is often effectively, having three people writing the same code at the same time is not. </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Note that for your final presentation, you'll be giving a mini "pitch": a short description of the problem ad how your app solves it better than the others. Then you'll give a demo that walks through your most impressive features. Your presentation may include Powerpoint/Presi slides, but it doesn't have to. 
</p>
<p>
  <b>Best of luck!</b>
</p>
