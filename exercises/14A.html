<h2>E1: Read This Note</h2>
<p class="info warning">
  JavaScript and jQuery are incredibly important parts of becoming a well-rounded web developer or designer. Any professional environment will expect you to at least be familiar with it, so even if you don't use Javascript in your final project, <b>please take the time to learn a little bit now</b>. In the worst case, you spend a bit of time learning a new language and making the coding part of your brain more versatile—that never hurt anyone!
</p>
<h2>E2: Practice</h2>
<p>
  As you learn Javascript, you may be surprised at how much knowing Ruby helps you pick it up. You're saying the same things, just in a different dialect. Work through the <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript">intro Javascript track</a> on Codecademy, and be able to do the last two modules, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/building-an-address-book/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661">Build a Phone Book</a> and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/courses/close-the-super-makert/0/1?curriculum_id=506324b3a7dffd00020bf661">Build a Cash Register</a>. You can try them right away, or work up to them—just make sure you can pass those! Work through these quickly—if you find yourself spending more than an hour, move on.
</p>
<h2>E3: Learn jQuery</h2>
<p>
  While Javascript is a programming language all on its own, jQuery adds a lot of functionality to it that makes is fantastic for the web. <a href="http://learn.jquery.com">learn.jquery.com</a> is where it starts: be able to complete the chapters "About jQuery", "Using jQuery Core", "Events", "Effects", and "AJAX".
