<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: Styled Up</h2>
<p>
  Add some styling to the Prodix home page. In particular, make the <code>alert</code> and <code>notice</code> paragraphs look nice. Center the content, and change how the links. 
</p>
<h2>E2: Search the Tweets</h2>
<p>
  Add a search feature to the Working Twitter app to search through the tweets. Remember, you'll need to add form in the view, a controller action, and model method to get this to work.
</p>
<h4>Paginate</h4>
<p>
  Add pagination to your tweets as well.
</p>
<h2 class="bonus">E3 (Bonus!): AJAX TWEETS</h2>
<p>
  Make it so that you can Tweet via AJAX—that is, when you create a Tweet, the browser sends a request that goes to your controller, creates the Tweet, comes back with all the Tweets including the new one, after which the browser can render them—all without refreshing the page.
