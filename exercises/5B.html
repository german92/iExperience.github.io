<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>
  You'll notice that as we get further into the lectures and learn more about Rails, the exercises become less guided. Instead of "write a function that does x, y, and z" with sample code, test cases, and solutions, it'll be more like "Build an app that does X!". It'll be up to you to apply all the principles of planning, stress testing and actually coding that we've learned so far. 
</p>
<h2>E1: Retweet</h2>
<p>
  Rebuild the Twitter app that we built in class, but try not to look at the slides as much as possible.
</p>

<h2>E2: Follow up</h2>
<p>
  Make sure you've finished the previous days' exercises. Where answers have been released, compare and make sure your code works. <b>Please take the time to do this.</b> Putting in a little bit of time to feel confident about the concepts now will make learning Rails <em>so much faster</em>. Yay speed.

<h2>The Real Deal</h2>
<p>
  Now that you've finally learned <b>how</b> to make a Rails app, it's time to start thinking about <b>what</b> exactly you want to build. That is, after all, what we're here at iExperiene to do: make stuff.
</p>
<p>
  But not just any stuff. We want you to think about the problems in your life, or about the problems in the lives of those you care about. There are so many ways (like with SOLAR FREAKIN' ROADWAYS) in which we can make the lives of ten, a thousand, or a million people's lives better, easier, less painful, healthier, and on and on. But before we get to that <em>scale</em>, start by thinking about two things:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Who or what do you really care about?
    </li>
    <li>
      How can you use technology to make things easier for them, or in doing that?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  This weekend, as you're touring Cape Town and experiencing the city first hand, keep those questions in the back of your mind. Sunday night, take a first crack at writing your <b>final project proposal</b>. It is not by any means the final ideaâ€”your idea will grow and evolve as you learn more and see more of the world. By Monday, you should have a brief description (200-300 words) and a list of features (10-20) for the first version of your application.
</p>
<p>
  One for our Twitter app might look like this:
  <pre><code># Twitter app
#### By The Bru, May 30, 2014

## Description

I want to build an application to make it easier for people to update friends,
family, and other acquaintances on the fleeting thoughts I have. I want to be 
able to quickly and easily share what I'm reading, pictures I'm looking at, 
videos I'm watching, or whatever else, with anyone who's interested. I want to 
be able to "follow" people I think are cool or are sharing cool things to get 
real-time updates on their thoughts, and like or reshare stuff to the people 
following me.

## Features

1. Create an account
  - The account should be secure: it should have a password
2. Add my personal info
3. Share something (I'll call this a Tweet)
  - Add images, videos and links into my Tweets
4. See what other people have shared
5. Follow the people I think are cool
6. See all the content from all the people I think are cool
  - Be able to reshare what they shared
  - Be able to like what they shared</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  That's already about 10 features, and you can easily think of more (think of how many more features Twitter actually has!). Be creative and solve <b>real</b> problems.

<h1>Have an awesome weekend!</h1>
