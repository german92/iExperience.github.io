<h2>E1: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<p>
  This exercise is actually more of a mini-project: we're going to work through building a simple tic-tac-toe application from scratch. Pick a partner who you haven't worked with before, create <code>tictactoe.rb</code> in <code>d4</code> and let's get started.
</p>
<h4>Step 1: TIC! (Planning)</h4>
<p>
  As usual, we're going to plan out our approach before we start coding away. Read the following carefully—your program must do the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Take input from two players</li>
    <li>Detect invalid input</li>
    <li>Keep track of whose turn it is</li>
    <li>Keep track of a board</li>
    <li>Keep track of which squares have been filled in on the board, and not let the same square be filled in more than once</li>
    <li>Detect a winner when a player has won</li>
  </ul>
  The player input will be an integer from 0-8 and the squares will be numbered top-left to bottom-right (0 is the top-left square, 2 is the top-right square, 4 is the middle square, and 8 is the bottom-right square).  
</p>
<p>
  In <code>tictactoe.rb</code>, answer the following questions:
</p>
<pre><code><span class="comment"># tictactoe.rb</span>

# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another array—it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen? 
# How do you keep track of which squares have Xs and which have Os?
# How do you detect a winner?
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?</code></pre>
<h4>Step 2: TAC! (Pseudo-code)</h4>
<p>
  <em>Pseudo-code</em> is an informal, high-level description of your program's operation. Pseudo-code is written in english and outlines your program's behavior using step by step instructions. An example for tic-tac-toe:
</p>
<pre><code># Every turn:
#   Update whose turn it is
#   Get user input
#   Update board
#   Check for winner</code></pre>
<p>
  Of course, that's pretty easy to write. However, it may be less obvious how you would translate pseudo-code into good ol' Ruby. What exactly is a turn? How does one update the board? These are questions you've started thinking about in Step 1. For Step 2, expand your thinking, and the above pseudo-code, to make a more detailed outline. That is, your writing may contain words like "Array" and "Hash", but probably doesn't contain any "[" or "{" glyphs. As you write, consider these questions, and be ready to answer them:
  <ul>
    <li>
      Do you need to make any classes or modules?
    </li>
    <li>
      What functionality are you using often? Do you need any helper methods?
    </li>
    <li>
      Again: is there a loop? What kind of loop? Does it end? When? How? If no loop, how is your program structured?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="hint info">
  It may be starting to become clear that coding is much more about <b>thinking</b> than anything else. While there isn't necessarily a best solution, there are solutions that are much more intuitive and easier to understand than others. Remember that code is meant to be read by <b>humans</b>, and when two pieces of code do the same thing with the same efficiency, the one that's simpler is always better.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Check in with a TA before continuing!</b>
</p>
<h4>Step 3: TOE! (Code)</h4>
<p>
  Now that you have your pseudo-code, it should be a simple matter to turn it into real code. Take a crack at it, and see if it works!
</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby tictactoe.rb 
Player 1:
0
Player 2:
1
Player 1:
kittens
Error: Invalid input
Player 1:
10
Error: Invalid input
Player 1:
3
Player 2:
2
Player 1:
2
Error: Square already taken
Player 1:
6
Congrats, player 1 won!</code></pre>
    
<p class="info hint">
  If you've gotten this far, you actually know quite a bit about coding, and the coding process. This was actually a Google coding interview problem (though keep that fact hush hush!). When you interview at companies—or try to code anything, really—this workflow is a good one to keep in mind: first <b>talk through</b> your solution and think about what <b>data structures</b> you'll use. Then write <b>pseudo-code</b> and try to foresee as many problems as you can. Only when you're confident in your <b>thinking</b> should you start coding.
</p>
<h4>Step 4: TIC-TAC-TOE! (User Experience)</h4>
<p>
  To be honest, while your program is pretty awesome, it's not very user friendly. Since humans aren't very good at remembering what the board looks like, add a method to print out the board after each step. We've picked a design below, but feel free to make it look like however you want.
</p>

<pre><code>$ ruby tictactoe.rb
Player 1:
4

<h2>E2: Bigger. Better. Quadrupled.</h2>
<p>
    Now that you've mastered the basics of tic-tac-toe, it's time to move on to bigger and better things. Choose one of the following extension projects:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Change your game into <b>EXTREME tic-tac-toe, AKA 4x4</b> (Guru difficulty)
            <p>
                Think about what kind of changes you will need to make to your program by following the steps you used for making the first game.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            Create <b>Connect Four</b> (Chosen One difficulty)
            <p>
                Recreate the (awesome) two-player sensation from the 70s. Think about the different rules that you will need for this game as opposed to tic-tac-toe, e.g. can a player put a disc wherever they want?
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 class="bonus">E4 (Bonus!): Computer Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<p>
  While playing against a person is fun, us loners need something to do. Write a program that <b>plays tic tac toe against you</b>. It should be smart!
</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby computer_tictactoe.rb
Would you like to be Player 1 or Player 2?
1
Player 1:
4
Computer: 0
   O |   |   
  ———+———+———
     | X |   
  ———+———+———
     |   |   
Player 1:
2
Computer: 6
6
   O |   | X 
  ———+———+———
     | X |   
  ———+———+———
   O |   |   
Player 1
5
Computer: 8
3
   O |   | X 
  ———+———+———
   O | X | X 
  ———+———+———
   O |   |   
The computer wins!
</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, it's pretty tough to get a computer to even be smart about something as simple as tic-tac-toe—the human brain is really amazing. Now consider how much code and intelligence is required to make a program that plays chess, or gives directions to some place depending on traffic and road closings...it's actually quite humbling.

<h2>Ruby: Fueling Consumerism</h2>
<p>
  Onward the plot to bring consumerism to Cape Town. We have the Goods and the Vehicle, all we need is the Villan.

<p>
  Create a <code>Shopper</code> class. It should:
  <ul>
    <li>Have one required parameter, <code>first_name</code></li>
    <li>Have <b>optional</b> parameters. The second parameter should be <code>last_name</code> (optional) and the third one should be <code>money</code> (the amount of money the shopper starts with).
    <li>If <code>money</code> is not provided in the <code>options</code> hash, then it should default to 100.</li>
    <li>Have methods to get a <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>money</code>, and a <code>full_name</code> method</li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>cart</code> property that is set to an empty <code>Cart</code> in the constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have <code>add_to_cart</code> and <code>remove_from_cart</code> methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>checkout</code> method that empties the cart and subtracts the total price of its items from <code>money</code> proprety, <b>only if</b> the shopper has enough money. If not, the method does nothing.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>More power, Less responsibility</h4>
<p>
  Now create a <code>SuperShopper</code> class. It should:
  <ul>
    <li>Extend <code>Shopper</code></li>
    <li>Receive a 10% discount on all items. That is, in its <code>checkout</code> method, only 90% of the total price of the cart is subtracted from <code>money</code>.</li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>get_money</code> method that takes an optional integer parameter and adds the input to the <code>money</code> property. If no input is specified, add 100.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  As with before, download the test script from <a href="../tests/shopping_cart_test_2.rb" target="_blank">here</a>. Save it into your <code>shopping_cart</code> directory, run it, and make all the tests pass!
</p>
<!--
<h4>More mustard!!</h4>
<p>
  Implement the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Give each shopper that's created an <code>id</code> attribute. It should update automatically—that is, when I create the first shopper, its id should be 1, the second shopper's should be 2, etc. This is not a property that can be overwritten. Hint: use a class variable.</li>
    <li>
      Create an array that keeps track of all the shoppers—when a shopper is created, it should automatically be added to that array. Do the same for items.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give <code>Shopper</code> a nice <code>to_s</code> method. Do the same for <code>Item</code> and <code>Cart</code>—in fact, shopper's <code>to_s</code> method should call cart's <code>to_s</code> method.
      <pre><code>bru = Shopper.new("bru")
puts bru
<span class="string"># => &lt;Shopper: id: 1, first_name: "bru", last_name: "", money: 100, cart: {}&gt;</span></code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
