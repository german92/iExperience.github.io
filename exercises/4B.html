  Or Zen, or whatever. Finish the d*** koans.
</p>
<h2>E2: Take a Breather</h2>
<p>
  Take a moment to review, catch up, and try any bonus problems that you skipped over. Make your personal page even prettier, or do something worth putting on you personal page. Call your mother. Relax for a second!

<h2>E3: And Back to Work</h2>
<p>
  Don't relax for too long. If you really find you're done with all the bonus problems and projects, then come to a TA. We have more fun stuff for you to do :)
