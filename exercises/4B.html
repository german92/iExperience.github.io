<h2>E2: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
<p>
  This one's more a mini-project: we're going to work through building a simple tic-tac-toe application from scratch. Pick a partner who you haven't worked with before, create <code>tictactoe.rb</code> in <code>d3</code> and let's get started.
</p>
<h4>Step 1: Planning</h4>
<p>
  As usual, we're going to plan out our approach before we begin coding. Read the following carefully—your program must:
  <ul>
    <li>Take input from two players</li>
    <li>Detect invalid input</li>
    <li>Keep track of whose turn it is</li>
    <li>Keep track of a board</li>
    <li>Keep track of which squares have been filled in on the board, and not let the same square be filled in more than once</li>
    <li>Detect a winner when a player has won</li>
  </ul>
  The input will be an integer from 0-8 and the squares will be numbered top-left to bottom-right (0 is the top-left square, 2 is the top-right square, 4 is the middle square, and 8 is the bottom-right square).  
</p>
<p>
  In <code>tictactoe.rb</code>, answer the following questions:
</p>
<pre><code><span class="comment"># tictactoe.rb</span>

# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another array—it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen? 
# How do you keep track of which squares have x's and which have o's?
# How do you detect a winner?
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?</code></pre>
<h4>Step 2: Pseudo-code</h4>
<p>
  <em>Pseudo-code</em> is code that's written in English; that is, step by step instructions for how your program behaves. An example:
</p>
<pre><code># Every turn:
#   Update whose turn it is
#   Get user input
#   Update board
#   Check for winner</code></pre>
<p>
  Of course, that's pretty easy to write, but may not be so obvious to translate into code. What exactly is a turn? How does one update the board? These are questions you've started thinking about in Step 1. For Step 2, expand your thinking and the above pseudo-code to make a more detailed outline. That is, your writing may contain words like "Array" and "Hash", but probably doesn't contain any "[" or "{". As you write, consider these questions, and be ready to answer them:
  <ul>
    <li>Do you need to make any classes or modules?</li>
    <li>
      What functionality are you using often? Do you need any helper methods?
    </li>
    <li>
      Again: is there a loop? What kind of loop? Does it end? When? How? If no loop, how is your program structured?
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p class="hint info">
  It may be starting to become clear that coding is much more about <b>thinking</b> than anything else. While there isn't necessarily a best solution, there are solutions that are much more intuitive and easier to understand than others. Remember that code is meant to be read by <b>humans</b>, and when two pieces of code do the same thing with the same efficiency, the one that's simpler is always better.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Check in with a TA before continuing!</b>
</p>
<h4>Step 3: Code</h4>
<p>
  Now that you have your pseudo-code, it should be a simple matter to turn it into real code. Take a crack at it, and see if it works. 
</p>
<pre><code>$ ruby tictactoe.rb 
Player 1:
0
Player 2:
1
Player 1:
kittens
Error: Invalid input
Player 1:
10
Error: Invalid input
Player 1:

Player 2:

Player 1:

Error: Square already taken
Player 1:

Congrats, player 1 won!</code></pre>
    
<p class="info hint">
  If you've gotten this far, you actually know quite a bit about coding, and the coding process. This was actually a Google coding interview problem (though keep that fact hush hush!). When you interview at companies—or try to code anything, really—this workflow is a good one to keep in mind: first <b>talk through</b> your solution and think about what <b>data structures</b> you'll use. Then write <b>pseudo-code</b> and try to foresee as many problems as you can. Only when you're confident in your <b>thinking</b> should you start coding.
</p>
<h4>Step 4: User Experience</h4>
<p>
  To be honest, while your program is cool, it's not very user friendly...humans aren't very good at remembering what the board looks like. Add a method to print out the board after each step. We've picked a design, but feel free to make it look like however you want.

<p>
  While playing against a person is fun, us loners need something to do. Write a program that <b>plays tic tac toe against you</b>. It should be smart!

</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, it's pretty tough to get a computer to even be smart about something as simple as tic-tac-toe—the human brain is really amazing. Now consider how much code and intelligence is required to make a program that plays chess, or gives directions to some place depending on traffic and road closings...it's actually quite humbling.

<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>Ruby: Fueling Consumerism</h2>
<p>
  Onward the plot to bring consumerism to Cape Town. We have the Goods and the Vehicle, all we need is the Villan.
</p>
<p>
  Create a <code>Shopper</code> class. It should:
  <ul>
    <li>Have one required parameter, <code>first_name</code></li>
    <li>Have <b>optional</b> parameters. The second parameter should be <code>last_name</code> (optional) and the third one should be <code>money</code> (the amount of money the shopper starts with).
    <li>If <code>money</code> is not provided in the <code>options</code> hash, then it should default to 100.</li>
    <li>Have methods to get a <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>money</code>, and a <code>full_name</code> method</li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>cart</code> property that is set to an empty <code>Cart</code> in the constructor.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have <code>add_to_cart</code> and <code>remove_from_cart</code> methods.
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>checkout</code> method that empties the cart and subtracts the total price of its items from <code>money</code> proprety, <b>only if</b> the shopper has enough money. If not, the method does nothing.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>More power, Less responsibility</h4>
<p>
  Now create a <code>SuperShopper</code> class. It should:
  <ul>
    <li>Extend <code>Shopper</code></li>
    <li>Receive a 10% discount on all items. That is, in its <code>checkout</code> method, only 90% of the total price of the cart is subtracted from <code>money</code>.</li>
    <li>
      Have a <code>get_money</code> method that takes an optional integer parameter and adds the input to the <code>money</code> property. If no input is specified, add 100.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  As with before, download the test script from <a href="../tests/shopping_cart_test_2.rb" target="_blank">here</a>. Save it into your <code>shopping_cart</code> directory, run it, and make all the tests pass!
</p>
<!--
<h4>More mustard!!</h4>
<p>
  Implement the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Give each shopper that's created an <code>id</code> attribute. It should update automatically—that is, when I create the first shopper, its id should be 1, the second shopper's should be 2, etc. This is not a property that can be overwritten. Hint: use a class variable.</li>
    <li>
      Create an array that keeps track of all the shoppers—when a shopper is created, it should automatically be added to that array. Do the same for items.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give <code>Shopper</code> a nice <code>to_s</code> method. Do the same for <code>Item</code> and <code>Cart</code>—in fact, shopper's <code>to_s</code> method should call cart's <code>to_s</code> method.
      <pre><code>bru = Shopper.new("bru")
puts bru
<span class="string"># => &lt;Shopper: id: 1, first_name: "bru", last_name: "", money: 100, cart: {}&gt;</span></code></pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h1>Getting Git</h1>
<p>
  You've all been utilizing Git and GitHub over the past few days as tools to save and share your work. But what exactly do they do, and what's the difference between the two? 
</p>
<p>
  The first thing we need to remember is that Git and GitHub are not the same thing. Git is a version control system that locally tracks your changes. Git does this by taking "snapshots" of your code (which Git calls commits) and then storing these commits in Git repositories (or repos). GitHub is a website that allows you to save your repos online and share them with other people. 
</p>
<p>
  If you aren't 100% clear on what this means, don't worry! Over time you will develop familiarity with both Git and GitHub and you'll soon be using both like pros.
</p>
<h4>Creating a local repo and linking it to GitHub</h4>
<p>
  Let's start by walking through the steps of creating and linking a repo to GitHub, paying special attention to which product (Git or GitHub) each command is targeting.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <code>git init</code>: The first thing we do after creating a project file is to initialize (init) a local Git repository in that folder. This creates a hidden <code>.git</code> folder that locally, i.e. on your computer, tracks changes made to the project. <code>git init</code> has nothing to do with GitHub.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git add .</code>: Next we add the changes we have made to the staging area (the period in this command is shorthand for all, i.e. add all changed files). You can add files individually by name as well, e.g. <code>git add file1</code>. Remember to add a file before running this command if the folder you've just created is empty. At this point you may be wondering whether your changes have been saved. They have not! The staging area is like a loading dock where you can decide which changes you want to ship (commit). We still need to ship them.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git commit -m "Your message"</code>: After choosing which files we want to commit using <code>git add</code>, we run the <code>git commit</code> command to save our changes to our local repo. Once we start having more commits, or our project has collaborators who also submit commits, we may want more information on the changes in each commit. Git allows us to do this by attaching a message with each commit. If we just run <code>git commit</code>, Git will open up a space where we can type our message. By adding the <code>-m</code> to our command, we can immediately add our message inside quotation marks. Commit messages are so important that Git actaully enforces their use, i.e. you cannot submit a commit without a message! Our changes have now been saved in our local Git repository. Let's move on to GitHub...
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame.git</code>: Up until now, all our Git commands have solely been targeting Git on our computer. We do this with the <code>git remote add origin</code> command. To utilize GitHub we need to link our local repo with our remote GitHub repo. After creating a repo on your GitHub account you can navigate to the repo page to see a list of instructions for linking the two repos. GitHub provides the URL you need to use in your command at the top of this page.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git push origin master</code>: We're nearly there! The last thing we need to do is push our locally stored commits to GitHub with the <code>git push</code> command. The <code>origin</code> part of our command refers to the original remote repository. We will use this repository almost exclusively for this course. The <code>master</code> part of the command refers to the branch we are currently working on. Again, you will predominantly be using the master branch in this course. Check out GitHub's documentation if you want to learn more about using branches.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You've succesfully created and linked a GitHub repo!</p>
<h4>Useful commands</h4>
<p>Git and GitHub are immensely powerful tools. The more time you spend learning about them and how they work, the more you will be able to get out of both products. Below are some extra commands that may come in handy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>git status</code>: If you're ever unsure about what's going on with Git, simply type <code>git status</code> to see the current status of your Git repository (or even if the current folder has a Git repo associated with it). 
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git diff</code>: Shows unstaged changes made since your last commit.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git rm file1</code>: Even though you can delete a file from a Git repo outside of the console, i.e. using Finder, it's better practice to delete the file using Git. If you don't do this, you'll find that <code>git add .</code> will not add the deletion to your staging area. You will have to run ...
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git add -u</code>: Adds deleted files to your staging area.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>git log</code>: Show recent commits, most recent on top.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>GitHub Pages: github.io </h4>
<p>GitHub pages are public webpages freely hosted through GitHub. To create a GitHub page, simply create a new repository named username.github.io on your GitHub account, where username is your username (or organization name) on GitHub. Remember that if the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right. You get one site per GitHub account and organization, and unlimited project sites.</p>
