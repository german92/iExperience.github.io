<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: ActiveReview</h2>
<p>
  Again, we went over a lot of methods! Make sure you understand what each one returns, and whether they are a <b>class</b> or <b>instance</b> method. Look them up if you forgot—thankfully, Rails has really good documentation with APIDock.
  <ul>
    <li><code>.all</code></li>
    <li><code>.first</code></li>
    <li><code>.new</code></li>
    <li><code>.find</code></li>
    <li><code>.find_by</code></li>
    <li><code>.where</code></li>
    <li><code>.save</code></li>
    <li><code>.update_attrbutes</code></li>
    <li><code>.destroy</code></li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  What's the difference between <code>.find</code> and <code>.find_by</code>?
  What's the difference between <code>.where</code> and <code>.find_by</code>?
</p>
<h2>E2: ActiveQuiz</h2>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>What is a database?</li>
    <li>What is a database table? How does it relate to a database? What's a good analogy for a database table (i.e. a way to visualize it)?</li>
    <li>Draw the <code>tweets</code> database table</li>
    <li>Why do we use models/resources at all?</li>
    <li>What is ActiveRecord?</li>
    <li>What's the difference between a database table, resource and an ActiveRecord model?</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>E3: Tweet Console</h2>
<p>
  Fire up <code>rails console</code>. Then do the following things:
  <ul>
    <li>Create a tweet.</li>
    <li>Find it with the <code>Tweet.find</code> method</li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.where(:user => "...")</code></li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.find_by(:user => "...")</code></li>
    <li>Describe to yourself what the difference is between those two methods.</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different tweeter name. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different body. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different id. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Delete that tweet</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>Tweet tweet</h4>
<p>
  A bit harder now:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create 10 Tweets programmatically, each with a different user and different body. You might want to write pseudo-code first!</li>
  <li>Destroy them all.</li>
  <li>Create 10 more the same way. Find the 4th one.</li>
  <li>Update all of them to have the body "iX TAs rock!"</li>
  <li>Update the fourth one to to have the body "And the teacher rocks sometimes, too".</li>
</ul>
<h2>E4: Keep Retweeting</h2>
<p>
  Again, rebuild the Twitter app from scratch. This time:
  <ul>
    <li>Add a header and footer to your <code>app/views/layouts/application.html.erb</code>, but make them partials and render with <code><%= render :partial => "header" %></code></li>
    <li>Expand <code>User</code> to have email, password, bio, and any other fields you think would be necessary.</li>
    <li>Similarly, add any fields to the <code>Tweet</code> model that you think might be useful.</li>
    <li>
      Change the <code>form_for</code> in the appropriate partials to use the right input fields. For example, for your user's email fields, you might use a <code>&lt;input type="email"&gt;</code>, but it might look like a <code>f.something_tag</code>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>Testing</h4>
<p>
  Just because we've moved past Ruby doesn't mean you should lose the coding principles that you learned there. Keep checking for edge cases, and verifying that your app is working the way it's supposed to. 
</p>
<h2 class="bonus">E5: Likey Likey</h2>
<p>
  How would you find all Tweets that have the word "awesome" in them? How would you find all Tweets that have words <em>like</em> "awesome" in them (<em>like</em> meaning "awesum" or "awesick", not synonyms like "cool" or "great")?
</p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>The Real Deal</h2>
<p>
  Now that you have some features, you want to come up with <b>user stories</b>, or typical workflows for all the types of actions. For our Twitter app, there are several that come to mind: A new user signing up, signing in, someone posting something, someone browsing tweets, following another user, etc.
</p>
<pre><code>...continuing from your previous document...

## User Stories

#### Sign up

1. User visits site
2. User clicks "Sign up"
3. User fills in name, email, password
4. User clicks "Submit"
  - If all is ok:
    - User is directed to home page
  - If email is invalid
    - User is shown an error message
  - If password is too short
    - User is shown an error message

#### Sign in

1. User visits site
2. User clicks "Sign in"
3. User fills in email and password
4. User clicks "Submit"
  - If email and password match
    - User is directed to main page
  - Otherwise
    - User is shown error message

#### Create a tweet

...

#### Follow a person

...

#### Search for a person

...

#### Search for tweets

...</code></pre>
<p>
  It might seem extremely verbose, but this a way of pseudo-coding applications: just like writing small programs, large apps need a lot of planning, too. This allows you to foresee a lot of problems that you may not have thought about. How exactly do I do a search? How do I render the results? And questions like that.
</p>
<p>
  Tomorrow, you'll present your idea, features and stories in front of the whole class, and the class will give you back feedback on problems they see. Put yourself in their shoes and think "If I were a user of my app, what would I improve?". It's much better to decide that your idea should be changed/improved/scrapped now, after only hours of work, instead of after days or even weeks of work. 
</p>
<h4>Mockups</h4>
<p>
  Since you guys have learned relatively more of HTML/CSS, you may want to start mocking up your interface. For each user story, you're going to want a screen for the user to perform those actions. Some designers like to draw on paper—you might go that route. Some like to sketch things in Photoshop or Illustrator, and if you have that software and are comfortable using it, then do that. But most coders are not superb drawers, so they like an online interface. We'd recommend <a href="http://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> or <a href="https://gomockingbird.com/" target="_blank">Mockingbird</a>. 
</p>
<!-- <h2>Fueling Consumerism on Rails</h2>
<p>
  We're going to begin the process of translating the project from last week into a Rails application. Each class (<code>Item</code>, <code>Cart</code>, <code>Shopper</code>...) will become its own model, and you'll write the controllers and views for them in time. This will also be a chance to go through the flow of building your own Rails application from scratch, as opposed to a codealong.
</p>
<p>
  In your <code>projects</code> directory, create a new Rails app called <code>shopping</code> (Hint: <code>rails new shopping</code>). Make sure you can get the server running; you may need to kill other servers that were previously running on your Terminal.
</p>
<p>
  As with before, we'll start with the <code>Item</code> class. Use scaffolding to generate an Item model. It should have a property <code>name</code>, which is a string, and a property <code>price</code>, which is a float. Once you've created it, verify it's working by visiting <code>localhost:3000/items</code> and creating, viewing and deleting a new item. What happens if you type a non-float in the price field? Can you figure out how to fix that?
</p>
<h4>Pretty 'n' Sassy</h4>
<p>
  Sass up your webpage! Use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide">SASS CSS</a> in your <code>app/assets/stylesheets/items.css.scss</code> to make your website pretty (the <code>.scss</code> extension means you can use SASS, much like how <code>.erb</code> means you can use Ruby in HTML). Remember to add styles that apply to all pages (like styles on <code>body</code> or all text, for example) in <code>application.css</code> (which you can rename <code>application.css.scss</code>) and only those that apply to the items page in <code>items.css.scss</code>.
</p>
<h4>Think...think...</h4>
<p>
  Think about how you might scaffold the <code>Cart</code>. Can you foresee any problems? What would you type into the Terminal? Write down the answers to these questions.
</p>
<h4>To the cloud!</h4>
<p>
  Create a new Github repo for your code, and push your code there. If you forgot how, check back in previous exercises or visit <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">here</a>.
