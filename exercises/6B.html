<h2>E1: Tweet</h2>
<p>
  Fire up <code>rails console</code>. Then do the following things:
  <ul>
    <li>Create a tweet.</li>
    <li>Find it with the <code>Tweet.find</code> method</li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.where(:user => "...")</code></li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.find_by(:user => "..."</code></li>
    <li>Describe to yourself what the difference is between those two methods.</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different tweeter name. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different body. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Update that tweet to have a different id. Is this possible?</li>
    <li>Delete that tweet</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h4>Tweet tweet</h4>
<p>
  A bit harder now:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create 10 Tweets programmatically, each with a different user and different body. You might want to write pseudo-code first!</li>
  <li>Destroy them all.</li>
  <li>Create 10 more the same way. Find the 4th one.</li>
  <li>Update all of them to have the body "iX TAs rock!"</li>
  <li>Update the fourth one to to have the body "And the teacher rocks sometimes, too".</li>
</ul>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<h2>The Real Deal</h2>
<p>
  Improve on your final project proposal. Talk to others about theirs, and start thinking about who you want to work with. You'll have to have a decision by Wednesday.
</p>
<h2>Fueling Consumerism on Rails</h2>
<p>
  We're going to begin the process of translating the project from last week into a Rails application. Each class (<code>Item</code>, <code>Cart</code>, <code>Shopper</code>...) will become its own model, and you'll write the controllers and views for them in time. This will also be a chance to go through the flow of building your own Rails application from scratch, as opposed to a codealong.
</p>
<p>
  In your <code>projects</code> directory, create a new Rails app called <code>shopping</code> (Hint: <code>rails new shopping</code>). Make sure you can get the server running; you may need to kill other servers that were previously running on your Terminal.
</p>
<p>
  As with before, we'll start with the <code>Item</code> class. Use scaffolding to generate an Item model. It should have a property <code>name</code>, which is a string, and a property <code>price</code>, which is a float. Once you've created it, verify it's working by visiting <code>localhost:3000/items</code> and creating, viewing and deleting a new item. What happens if you type a non-float in the price field? Can you figure out how to fix that?
</p>
<h4>Pretty 'n' Sassy</h4>
<p>
  Sass up your webpage! Use <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide">SASS CSS</a> in your <code>app/assets/stylesheets/items.css.scss</code> to make your website pretty (the <code>.scss</code> extension means you can use SASS, much like how <code>.erb</code> means you can use Ruby in HTML). Remember to add styles that apply to all pages (like styles on <code>body</code> or all text, for example) in <code>application.css</code> (which you can rename <code>application.css.scss</code>) and only those that apply to the items page in <code>items.css.scss</code>.
</p>
<h4>Think...think...</h4>
<p>
  Think about how you might scaffold the <code>Cart</code>. Can you foresee any problems? What would you type into the Terminal? Write down the answers to these questions.
</p>
<h4>To the cloud!</h4>
<p>
  Create a new Github repo for your code, and push your code there. If you forgot how, check back in previous exercises or visit <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">here</a>.
