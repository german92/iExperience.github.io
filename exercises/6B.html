    <li>Create a tweet.</li>
    <li>Find it with the <code>Tweet.find</code> method</li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.where(:user => "...")</code></li>
    <li>Find it by user with <code>Tweet.find_by(:user => "..."</code></li>
    <li>Describe to yourself what the difference is between those two methods.</li>

<h4>Tweet tweet</h4>

  A bit harder now:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create 10 Tweets programmatically, each with a different user and different body. You might want to write pseudo-code first!</li>
  <li>Destroy them all.</li>
  <li>Create 10 more the same way. Find the 4th one.</li>
  <li>Update all of them to have the body "iX TAs rock!"</li>
  <li>Update the fourth one to to have the body "And the teacher rocks sometimes, too".</li>
</ul>
