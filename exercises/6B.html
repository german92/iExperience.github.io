<h2>E1: Retweet Again</h2>
<p>
  Perfect practice makes perfect. Recreate the Twitter app again, from scratch, but now with:
  <ul>
    <li>A header and a footer in the layout</li>
    <li>Using at least one <code>link_to</code> and one <code>image_tag</code></li>
    <li>A <code>form_for</code> tag for the <code>User</code> view</li>
  </ul>
  Try to look at the codealong from class as infrequently as possible.
