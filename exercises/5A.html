  Good news: not much coding for this lecture! We want to make sure you have an accurate picture of what the internet, web servers, clients, applications, and all the other moving parts that come into play when you type in iExperience.github.io in your browser.
</p>
<h2>E1: So what IS going on?</h2>
<p>
  Write down, step by step, what happens between the time you press enter in the URL bar in your browser and before you see a page on your screen. In particular, make sure you cover these questions in your steps (but you should have many steps in addition to the answers to these questions).
  <ol>
    <li>What is a request?</li>
    <li>What is making the request?</li>
    <li>Where does the request go (like physically, on Earth, as well as conceptually, on the internet)? What's its "address"?</li>
    <li>What happens to the request when it gets "there"?</li>
    <li>What comes back? What is it? What data does it contain?</li>
    <li>What happens when it comes back?</li>
  </ol>
</p>

  <ol>
    <li>A request is some data sent over the internet from one computer to another to <b>ask for data</b>. When using the internet, most of your requests ask for HTML. But sometimes, like when using APIs, it might ask for other types of data, like JSON.</li>
    <li>The client, or web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc) makes the request.</li>
    <li>The address is its IP address (something that looks like 185.31.18.133). That gets decoded, much like a street address, and the internet knows where that computer is. How? That's pretty complicatedâ€”if you're curious, you can do some Googling!</li>
    <li>The request is processed by the server, which runs some code and returns data.</li>
    <li>A <em>response</em> is what comes back. The response usually contains HTML, but sometimes some other kinds of data (JSON, images, stylesheets, fonts...)</li>
    <li>The browser processes it and renders it on your screen.</li>
  </ol>

<h2>E2: Rafi Rocks</h2>
<p>
  Go to <a href="http://www.iexperience.github.io/exercises/rafi_rocks" target="_blank">iexperience.github.io/exercises/rafi_rocks</a>. What shows up on the screen? What does it mean? Why is it that particular number? You may have to do some Googling.
</p>
{% if page.answers_shown %}
<a class="hover-show pull-right">Hover for answer</a>
<div class="hover-hide">
  A big "This page does not exist" screen shows up, with the number 404. 404 corresponds to a particular <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html" target="_blank"><em>HTTP status code</em></a>. There are many, and each one tells the browser whether the request succeeded, failed, went to the wrong place, etc.

<h2>The Long Road to Rails</h2>
<p>
  Make your personal page render with Ruby on Rails. Your steps might be something like:
  <pre><code>$ rails new personal
...move files into the 'right' places</code></pre>

  And that's it!
