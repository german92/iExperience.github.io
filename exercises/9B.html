<h2>E1: Validations Review </h2>

<ol>
	<li> Where do you write validations and why? Are there any validations that go in the controller? </li>
 	<li> Why does the code below respond false on <code> user.save?</code>. When does a <code> user.valid?</code> return true? <br>
		<pre><code>>> user = User.new(:name => "", :email => "mhartl@example.com") 
>> user.valid?
<span class="comment">=> false</span>
>> user.save
<span class="comment">=> false</span></code></pre>

	<li> What's one line of code to check if a User attribute has any errors? Hint: We did this in the console. </li>

	<li> Is it possible to validate relations? Think of validations for the relations in the Twitter app. Hint: Google for Rails relations validations.</li>
</ol>

<h2>E2: I Need Validation</h2>
<p>
	Let's add some more validations because, well, some of us are just insecure sometimes.
	<ul>
		<li>Make it so the handle must be at least 4 characters long (including the @).</li>
		<li>Make it so the handle must start with an @, but can't have a number as its second character (you'll need another custom validator).</li>
		<li>Grammar police: make it so tweets must start with a capital letter.</li>
		<li><b>Bonus</b>: check in the model that the email is indeed a valid email. You'll need to use <b>regular expressions</b>—don't add an extra gem, use your own validator method.</li>
	</ul>
