<h2>E1: Validations Review </h2>

<ol>
	<li> Where do you write validations and why? Are there any validations that go in the Controller? </li>
	<li> 
 	<li> Why does the code below respond false on <code> user.save? </code> When does a <code> user.valid? </code> return true? <br>
	<code> >> user = User.new(:name => "", :email => "mhartl@example.com") ,</code> <br>
	 <code> >> user.save </code> <br>
	 <code> => false </code> <br>
	 <code> >>user.valid? </code> <br> 
	 <code> => false </code> <br>

	<li> Write a one line code to check if a User attribute has any errors. Hint: We did this in the console. </li>

	<li> Is it possible to validate relations? Think of validations for the relations in the Twitter app. </li>
</ol>

<h2>E2: Nasty long names and emails and descriptions? </h2>

<p> Yes, people have long names. Decide on a good length and add it as a validation. Repeat for email and Bio. 
</p>

<h2>E3: Want to/Don't want to describe yourself? </h2>

<p> 
 Currently, your twitter app doesn't handle validations for the bio field in the User model. Think of a validation required for this field. Can you keep it blank or should there always be content in it? 
 Hint: you may need to use Google for reference
</p>

<h2>E4: Another validation? </h3>

<p>
You learned in class to create conditional validations. Your User class requires the user.handle to start with @. Similary, write a method in the User class to ensure a handle must start with a letter. </p>
