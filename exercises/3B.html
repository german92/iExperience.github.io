    <h2>E1: String Theory</h2>
    <p>
      A common way to practice arrays and methods is to write <em>string manipulation</em> methods, or methods that modify strings. The cool thing about Ruby is that you can always modify any class and add methods to it. For example, instead of our <code>shout</code> method, we could have written it into the <code>String</code> class itself:
    </p>
    <pre><code>class String
  def shout
    self.upcase
  end
end

"hElLo".shout
<span class="string"># => "HELLO"</span></code></pre>
    <p>
      For this exercise, we're going to add some methods to the <code>String</code> class. Create <code>d3/super_strings.rb</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Iglatinpay</h4>
    <p>
      You may be familiar with <em>Piglatin</em>, which is a language just like English, but each first letter of a word is put at the end and followed by "ay". So, "Piglatin" in Piglatin is "Iglatinpay", and "iglatinpay" is "glatinpayiay". Write a method <code>piglatinify</code> to get this behavior.
    </p>
    <h4>Histay Siay Iglatinpay</h4>
    <p>
      Write a method <code>piglatinify_sentence</code> that makes each word in a sentence into Piglatin.
    </p>
    <h4>Strip Down</h4>
    <p>
      Write the method <code>strip</code> (but call it <code>strip_new</code>). Test it against Ruby's strip with a variety of test samples. Does it always behave the same?
    </p>

    <pre><code><span class="comment"># super_strings.rb</span>

# Your code here

"piglatin".piglatinify
<span class="string"># => "iglatinpay"</span>
"Piglatin".piglatinify
<span class="string"># => "Iglatinpay" (watch out for capital letters!)</span>
"This is Piglatin".piglatinify_sentence
<span class="string"># => "Histay siay Iglatinpay"</span>
" 
  tripsay emay \t ".strip_new
<span class="string"># => "tripsay emay"</span>
</code></pre>

    <h2>E2: Modulify</h2>
    <p>
      Make your Piglatin methods into a module called <code>Piglatinify</code> in <code>piglatinify.rb</code>. The two methods should work on any class (perhaps the <code>to_s</code> method will come in handy here). Test by creating another file.
    </p>
    <pre><code><span class="comment"># d3/some_other_file.rb</span>

require_relative 'piglatinify'

class Array
  include Piglatinify
end
["a", "b", "c"].piglatinify
<span class="string"># => "\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"][ay"</span></code></pre>
    <h2>E4: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <p>
      This one's more a mini-project: we're going to work through building a simple tic-tac-toe application from scratch. Pick a partner who you haven't worked with before, create <code>tictactoe.rb</code> in <code>d3</code> and let's get started.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1: Planning</h4>
    <p>
      As usual, we're going to plan out our approach before we begin coding. Read the following carefully—your program must:
      <ul>
        <li>Take input from two players</li>
        <li>Detect invalid input</li>
        <li>Keep track of whose turn it is</li>
        <li>Keep track of a board</li>
        <li>Keep track of which squares have been filled in on the board, and not let the same square be filled in more than once</li>
        <li>Detect a winner when a player has won</li>
      </ul>
      The input will be an integer from 0-8 and the squares will be numbered top-left to bottom-right (0 is the top-left square, 2 is the top-right square, 4 is the middle square, and 8 is the bottom-right square).  
    </p>
    <p>
      In <code>tictactoe.rb</code>, answer the following questions:
    </p>
    <pre><code><span class="comment"># tictactoe.rb</span>

# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another array—it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen? 
# How do you keep track of which squares have x's and which have o's?
# How do you detect a winner?
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?</code></pre>
    <h4>Step 2: Pseudo-code</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Pseudo-code</em> is code that's written in English; that is, step by step instructions for how your program behaves. An example:
    </p>
    <pre><code># Every turn:
#   Update whose turn it is
#   Get user input
#   Update board
#   Check for winner</code></pre>
    <p>
      Of course, that's pretty easy to write, but may not be so obvious to translate into code. What exactly is a turn? How does one update the board? These are questions you've started thinking about in Step 1. For Step 2, expand your thinking and the above pseudo-code to make a more detailed outline. That is, your writing may contain words like "Array" and "Hash", but probably doesn't contain any "[" or "{". As you write, consider these questions, and be ready to answer them:
      <ul>
        <li>Do you need to make any classes or modules?</li>
        <li>
          What functionality are you using often? Do you need any helper methods?
        </li>
        <li>
          Again: is there a loop? What kind of loop? Does it end? When? How? If no loop, how is your program structured?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="hint info">
      It may be starting to become clear that coding is much more about <b>thinking</b> than anything else. While there isn't necessarily a best solution, there are solutions that are much more intuitive and easier to understand than others. Remember that code is meant to be read by <b>humans</b>, and when two pieces of code do the same thing with the same efficiency, the one that's simpler is always better.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>Step 3: Code</h4>
    <p>
      Now that you have your pseudo-code, it should be a simple matter to turn it into real code. Take a crack, and see if it works. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby tictactoe.rb

    <p class="info hint">
      If you've gotten this far, you actually know quite a bit about coding, and the coding process. This was actually a Google coding interview problem (though keep that fact hush hush!). When you interview at companies—or try to code anything, really—this workflow is a good one to keep in mind: first <b>talk through</b> your solution and think about what <b>data structures</b> you'll use. Then write <b>pseudo-code</b> and try to foresee as many problems as you can. Only when you're confident in your <b>thinking</b> should you start coding.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4: User Experience</h4>
    <p>
      To be honest, while your program is cool, it's not very user friendly...humans aren't very good at remembering what the board looks like. Add a method to print out the board after each step. We've picked a design, but feel free to make it look like however you want.

    <p>
      As you can see, it's pretty tough to get a computer to even be smart about something as simple as tic-tac-toe—the human brain is really amazing. Now consider how much code and intelligence is required to make a program that plays chess, or gives directions to some place depending on traffic and road closings...it's actually quite humbling.

      Create a <code>Shopper</code> class. It should:
      <ul>
        <li>Have one required parameter, <code>first_name</code></li>
        <li>Optionally have <code>last_name</code> and <code>money</code> properties, which should be input via an <code>options</code> hash in the constructor.</li>
        <li>If <code>money</code> is not provided in the <code>options</code> hash, then it should default to 100.</li>
        <li>Have methods to get a <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code> and <code>money</code>, and a <code>full_name</code> method</li>
        <li>
          Have a <code>cart</code> property that is set to an empty <code>Cart</code> in the constructor.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have <code>add_to_cart</code> and <code>remove_from_cart</code> methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Have a <code>checkout</code> method that empties the cart and subtracts the total price of its items from <code>money</code> proprety, <b>only if</b> the shopper has enough money. If not, the method does nothing.

    <h4>More power, Less responsibility</h4>

        <li>Receive a 10% discount on all items. That is, in its <code>checkout</code> method, only 90% of the total price of the cart is subtracted from <code>money</code>.</li>
        <li>
          Have a <code>get_money</code> method that takes an optional integer parameter and adds the input to the <code>money</code> property. If no input is specified, add 100.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      As with before, download the test script from <a href="../files/shopping_cart_test_2.rb" target="_blank">here</a>. Save it into your <code>shopping_cart</code> directory, run it, and make all the tests pass!
