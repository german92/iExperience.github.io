    <h2>E4: Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <p>
      This one's more a mini-project: we're going to work through building a simple tic-tac-toe application from scratch. Pick a partner who you haven't worked with before, create <code>tictactoe.rb</code> in <code>d3</code> and let's get started.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 1: Planning</h4>
    <p>
      As usual, we're going to plan out our approach before we begin coding. Read the following carefully—your program must:
      <ul>
        <li>Take input from two players</li>
        <li>Detect invalid input</li>
        <li>Keep track of whose turn it is</li>
        <li>Keep track of a board</li>
        <li>Keep track of which squares have been filled in on the board, and not let the same square be filled in more than once</li>
        <li>Detect a winner when a player has won</li>
      </ul>
      The input will be an integer from 0-8 and the squares will be numbered top-left to bottom-right (0 is the top-left square, 2 is the top-right square, 4 is the middle square, and 8 is the bottom-right square).  
    </p>
    <p>
      In <code>tictactoe.rb</code>, answer the following questions:
    </p>
    <pre><code><span class="comment"># tictactoe.rb</span>

# How will you keep track of whose turn it is?
# What data structure will you use to keep track of the board? You only
#   know two (Array, Hash), but remember they can be nested (meaning an
#   array can contain another array—it can even contain a hash that contains
#   another hash, though unclear if that will be useful :P)
# When a player makes a move, what should happen? 
# How do you keep track of which squares have x's and which have o's?
# How do you detect a winner?
# When does the program stop? Is there a loop? If so, what kind?</code></pre>
    <h4>Step 2: Pseudo-code</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Pseudo-code</em> is code that's written in English; that is, step by step instructions for how your program behaves. An example:
    </p>
    <pre><code># Every turn:
#   Update whose turn it is
#   Get user input
#   Update board
#   Check for winner</code></pre>
    <p>
      Of course, that's pretty easy to write, but may not be so obvious to translate into code. What exactly is a turn? How does one update the board? These are questions you've started thinking about in Step 1. For Step 2, expand your thinking and the above pseudo-code to make a more detailed outline. That is, your writing may contain words like "Array" and "Hash", but probably doesn't contain any "[" or "{". As you write, consider these questions, and be ready to answer them:
      <ul>
        <li>Do you need to make any classes or modules?</li>
        <li>
          What functionality are you using often? Do you need any helper methods?
        </li>
        <li>
          Again: is there a loop? What kind of loop? Does it end? When? How? If no loop, how is your program structured?
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="hint info">
      It may be starting to become clear that coding is much more about <b>thinking</b> than anything else. While there isn't necessarily a best solution, there are solutions that are much more intuitive and easier to understand than others. Remember that code is meant to be read by <b>humans</b>, and when two pieces of code do the same thing with the same efficiency, the one that's simpler is always better.
    </p>

    </p>
    <h4>Step 3: Code</h4>
    <p>
      Now that you have your pseudo-code, it should be a simple matter to turn it into real code. Take a crack, and see if it works. 
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby tictactoe.rb

Congrats, player 1 won!</code></pre>
    
    <p class="info hint">
      If you've gotten this far, you actually know quite a bit about coding, and the coding process. This was actually a Google coding interview problem (though keep that fact hush hush!). When you interview at companies—or try to code anything, really—this workflow is a good one to keep in mind: first <b>talk through</b> your solution and think about what <b>data structures</b> you'll use. Then write <b>pseudo-code</b> and try to foresee as many problems as you can. Only when you're confident in your <b>thinking</b> should you start coding.
    </p>
    <h4>Step 4: User Experience</h4>
    <p>
      To be honest, while your program is cool, it's not very user friendly...humans aren't very good at remembering what the board looks like. Add a method to print out the board after each step. We've picked a design, but feel free to make it look like however you want.

    <h2 class="bonus">E5 (Bonus!): Computer Tic-Tac-Toe</h2>
    <p>
      While playing against a person is fun, us loners need something to do. Write a program that <b>plays tic tac toe against you</b>. It should be smart!
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby computer_tictactoe.rb

</code></pre>
    <p>
      As you can see, it's pretty tough to get a computer to even be smart about something as simple as tic-tac-toe—the human brain is really amazing. Now consider how much code and intelligence is required to make a program that plays chess, or gives directions to some place depending on traffic and road closings...it's actually quite humbling.
