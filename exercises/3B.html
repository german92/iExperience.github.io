<h2>E1/Project: API FUN</h2>
<h4>Step 1: F</h4>
<p>
  F is for friends, who code stuff together. You're going to be given a partner to work with. Together, think of a cool use of one of the APIs we've learned, or find some others. Run your idea by a TA to make sure it's feasible. Make a repo on GitHub for your project, so you can push your local changes to GitHub. 
</p>
<h4>Step 2: U</h4>
<p>
  U is for u and me. To work together, we'll need a way to collaborate. Add all group members as collaborators. Make sure each of you have a copy of the repo on your machine and can push changes to it.
</p>
<h4>Step 3: N</h4>
<p>
  N is for 'n' get to work! Spec out, plan and pseudo-code your project. Divide up the tasks and write the code.
