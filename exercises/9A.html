<h2>E1: CRUDdy Review</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Map CRUD to HTTP methods, for example <code>index</code> is <code>GET</code> (y’all should probably have these down by now)</li>
  <li>
    For an application containing an author, authorship, and books, list all the relations that exist.
  </li>
    
  <li>
    A certain route.rb file has a <code>get products/:id</code> line. What can be an example to the corresponding URL issued by the browser? What params are set? 
  </li>
  <li>
    What HTTP method does a form submission use by default?
  </li>
  <li>
    What is the difference between an edit and update action? Similarly, what is the difference between new and create?
  </li>
</ol>


<h2>E2: I Don't Want Any Part of This</h2>
<p>
  Create a delete button on the user account that works. As an added bonus, make the button ask for confirmation before it deleted the account. Hint: the scaffolding code we created earlier in the course does this—checking it might provide clues on how to do this. 
</p>
<p>
  Also, try adding an edit button to be able to edit a user.
</p>
<h4>Not So Easy to Leave</h4>
<p>
  As you may note, once you delete a user, your application will start having errors, complaining that now there are some lonely tweets. Make it so when a user gets deleted, all his/her tweets are deleted as well. <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html" target="_blank">This</a> might prove useful. Hint: your answer should require less than one line of code.
</p>
<h2>E3: A Pretty Date ;)</h2>
<p>
  The "created at 2014-06-05 08:29:04 UTC" is pretty ugly. Research the <code>strftime</code> method to make your date nicer to look at.
</p>
<h2>E4: Catch up</h2> 
<p>
  Since most of you have been trying to finish up on previous exercises, we’ve decided to give you some time to finish and ask questions. It is VV important to finish these exercises, so please get them done while we are around and can help you debug!
