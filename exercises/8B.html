<h2>E2: Petitions on Rails</h2>
<p>
  We recently took the reddit Ruby app and turned it into a Rails application. Your task is to do the very same thing to our <a href="https://github.com/iexperience/petitions">Petitions</a> Ruby app.

  To do so, follow the steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Follow the same steps from lesson 7B to take the Reddit Ruby app into a Rails app</li>
    <li>Follow the steps we did today to add forms for parameters to configure the feed (e.g. choosing different kinds of petitions such as open or closed)</li>
  </ol>
  
  For convenience, below is a list of steps reviewing what we did at a high level in 8B's lecture:

  <h3>Code-Along: Reddit Rails Cont'd Steps</h2>

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone the <a href="github.com/iexperience/reddit_rails">reddit_rails</a> repo</li>
      <li>Run the rails server and re-familiarize yourself with the app and how it works</li>
      <li>Go into the index view and add a form_tag and a select tag to select which feed you want ("top", "hot")</li>
      <li>Create a submit button and a new action (e.g. 'filter') to handle the submission from the form</li>
      <li>Add a new route for the POST action in your routes file</li>
      <li>Add a new method in your controller for the 'filter' action, to filter stories by the params</li>
    </ol>
