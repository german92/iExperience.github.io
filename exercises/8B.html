<h2>Code-Along: Reddit Rails Cont'd Steps</h2>

Let's review the steps we took to enhance our Reddit Rails application to allow filtering the stories by feed, and other options.

<p>
	<ol>
		<li>Clone the <a href="github.com/iexperience/reddit_rails">reddit_rails</a> repo</li>
		<li>Run the rails server and re-familiarize yourself with the app and how it works</li>
		<li>Go into the index view and add a form_tag and a select tag to select which feed you want ("top", "hot")</li>
		<li>Create a submit button and a new action (e.g. 'filter') to handle the submission from the form</li>
		<li>Add a new route for the POST action in your routes file</li>
		<li>Add a new method in your controller for the 'filter' action, to filter stories by the params</li>
	</ol>
