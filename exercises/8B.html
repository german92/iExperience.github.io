<h2>E1: Request Params Review</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>What are the different request methods?</li>
    <li>What is each one primarily used for?</li>
    <li>If you are visiting a web page with your browser, what request method is used for that request?</li>
    <li>If you are submitting a form to create a new resource, what request method is used for that request?</li>
    <li>If you are updating a resource, what method is used for that?</li>
    <li>If you are removing a resource, what method is used for that?</li>
  </ol>

<h2>E2: Petitions on Rails</h2>
<p>
  We recently took the reddit Ruby app and turned it into a Rails application. Then you did the same for our <a href="https://github.com/iexperience/petitions">petitions</a> Ruby app in exercises for day 7.

  Now, just like we did in today's code-along, add form fields to be able to see the different kinds of petitions (open, closed), and search through them using form fields and the <code>params</code> hash on the back end.
</p>
<p>
  For convenience, below is a list of steps reviewing what we did at a high level in 8B's lecture:

  <h4>Code-Along: Reddit Rails Cont'd Steps</h4>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone the <a href="github.com/iexperience/reddit_rails">reddit_rails</a> repo</li>
    <li>Run the rails server and re-familiarize yourself with the app and how it works</li>
    <li>Go into the index view and add a form_tag and a select tag to select which feed you want ("top", "hot")</li>
    <li>Create a submit button and a new action (e.g. 'filter') to handle the submission from the form</li>
    <li>Add a new route for the POST action in your routes file</li>
    <li>Add a new method in your controller for the 'filter' action, to filter stories by the params</li>
  </ol>
