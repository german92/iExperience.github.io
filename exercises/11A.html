<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: Cookies and Sessions</h2>
<p>
  Write down your answers to the following:
  <ol>
    <li>What are cookies? Where are they stored?</li>
    <li>Why do we use cookies?</li>
    <li>Why are cookies encrypted? What could a malicious person do if they got a hold of your cookies?</li>
    <li>Are cookies sent with every browser request? Are all of them sent, or only a subset?</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>E2: Devise a Solution</h2>
<p>
  Recreate the codealong from scratch. You can use the lecture slides, the <a href="https://github.com/iExperience/devise_practice/tree/1999561779d4ae07b5d83c2756658e9ab82fc888">Code on Github</a>, the <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise">RailsCast</a>, or the <a href="http://devise.plataformatec.com.br/#starting-with-rails">Devise documentation</a> for reference. Add links to be able to sign up, sign in and sign out. 
</p>
<h4>Customization</h4>
<p>
  Customize Devise to get rid of the "forgot password?" and "remember me?" links.
</p>
<h2>E3: Revise your Twitter</h2>
<p>
  Use Devise to add user accounts and authentication to <code>working_twitter</code> (code <a href="https://github.com/iExperience/working_twitter">here</a>). Make it so anyone can view all the tweets, but you can only add and delete tweets if you're logged in. Note: you'll have to destroy and regenerate the User model, or modify it significantly and write new migrations!
