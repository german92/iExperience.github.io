<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: Gaining Familiarity</h2>
<p>
  Learn the name, hometown, interests and some interesting facts about two of the people sitting near you.
</p>
<h2>E2: A Bit More Setup</h2>
<p>
  We're going to build off of the prework to set up the working environment. All this material should be review, but if you have questions don't hesitate to ask. 
</p>
<p>
  In your home folder, create a folder called <code>iX</code> (note that <code>~</code> is a shortcut for <code>/Users/your-name</code> on a Mac). Inside that, create a folder called <code>workspace</code>. In your shell, switch to that directory with <code>cd</code> or <code>dir</code> and start a git repository. Lastly, create a folder called <code>d1</code> (for day 1).
  <pre><code>$ cd ~ 
$ mkdir iX
$ cd iX
$ mkdir workspace
$ cd workspace
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/my_name/workspace/.git/
$ mkdir d1</code></pre>
</p>
<p class="info warning">
  Windows users: While all the examples and screenshots are done on Macs, all the code should work (after slight modification) on your machine, especially if you have Cygwin or Git bash installed. If you don't and are stuck, please ask one of the TA's and they'll help you out!
</p>
<p>
  Every day, you'll create a new folder for the classwork done during that day. Next, open the folder you've created in Sublime Text (File -> Open and then choose the folder on a Mac, File -> Open Folder... then choose the folder on Windows). Your Sublime should look exactly like below:
  <img src="../images/exercises/1.sublime-1.png" class="centered bordered">
  Right click on the <code>d1</code> folder and choose "New File". Then save that file (File -> Save or Command-s on Mac or Ctrl-s on PC) as <code>first.html</code>. Now your screen should look like this:
  <img src="../images/exercises/1.sublime-2.png" alt="" class="centered bordered">
</p>
<p>
  In that file, type <code>&lt;p&gt;hello world!&lt;/p&gt;</code>. Make sure to save again, and then open that folder in Google Chrome (right click on the file in the Sublime left sidebar and choose "Reveal in Finder". Then right click on the file in Finder and choose Open With -> Google Chrome). Now you should see a page in Chrome with <code>hello world</code> written on itâ€”congratulations, you've made your first web page at iExperience! 
</p>
<p class="info hint">
  Protip (Macs): Set your default application for html files as Chrome: Right-click on any HTML file, and choose "Get Info". Then choose Chrome as the Open With, and click "Change All...". Then you can just type <code>open filename.html</code> in the Terminal and it'll come up. No more using the mouse!
</p>
<h2>E3: A Real Web Page</h2>
<p>
  For this exercise, we're going to make a real web page, using the <code>html</code>, <code>head</code> and <code>body</code> tags you've already learned. Create a new file in the <code>d1</code> folder called <code>second.html</code> and write the following (don't copy paste!):
  <pre><code><span class="doctype">&lt;doctype html&gt;</span>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;My second webpage&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</p>
<p>
  Open it in Chrome...do you see any difference betweeen this web page and the one you created in E2?
</p>
<h2>E4: Create a repo, commit and push!</h2>
We'll work together to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo" target="_blank">create a repo on</a> Github called iX-workspace. Then, just like in the prework, tell your repository about the new repo, commit your changes, and push! First, run the commands below to make sure you're doing the right thing. 
<pre><code>$ pwd
/Users/your_name/iX/workspace
$ ls
d1
$ ls d1
first.html second.html
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Made first html files"
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/<em>username</em>/iX-workspace.git
$ git push -u origin master</code></pre>

<h2>A Coder's Selfie</h2>
<p>
  Over the next few weeks, you'll have a chance to show off the HTML and CSS you've learned in the prework by building your own personal page. Doing so is a great way to create an online presence that's a bit more unique than having a Facebook/Twitter/LinkedIn/Github, and lets others see what a good designer and coder you are. It's also a great form of expression that allows you to make a small mark in your corner of the Internet. At the very least, it's great practice for the other phenomenal websites you'll build!
</p>
<p>
  To put your page on the internet, we'll be using 
  <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Github pages</a>. To start, follow the instructions there for a User site (not a project site). In the "Clone the repository" step, make sure you clone into the <code>projects</code> directory.
</p>
<img src="../images/exercises/1.sublime-3.png" class="centered bordered">
<p class="info warning">
  Note that yours won't be called <code>iExperience.github.io</code>, but <code>github-username.github.io</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Continue to follow the directions, creating a properly created <code>index.html</code> page. After you're done, you'll have your very own, personalized internet presence! It should look something like <a href="http://iexperience.github.io/personal/1A.html" target="_blank">this</a>, except the URL should not include <code>/personal/1A.html</code>.
</p>
