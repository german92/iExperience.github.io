<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: Many, Many, Many</h2>
<p>
  Give some examples of <code>has and belongs to many</code> (HABTM) relations. What would be the column names in the join table between those two models?
</p>
<h2>E2: GroupYou</h2>
<p>
  Recreate the GroupMe app from class (code <a href="https://github.com/iExperience/groupme/tree/2b05a48fcd1ce1667f08edc7f84a723963f803a6">here</a>). Add functionality to see all users. In the <code>db/seeds.rb</code> file, add some other users to some groups (run with <code>rake db:seed</code>), then create a page where you can see all the users in a group. Hint: that would be a group <code>show</code> action, with the URL <code>/groups/:id</code>.
