<h1>Exercises</h1>
<h2>E1: Relation Review</h2>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Why do we use relations? What are they good for?</li>
    <li>Will you ever write a relation on just one class, or will a relation always join two classes together?</li>
    <li>What types of relations did we learn about? What makes them unique? Can you give examples of each? Hint: We learned about 4 different kinds and an extension.</li>
    <li>What changes do you have to make to migrations for each relation? Does every single one require making changes to the database?</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>E2: We Belong Together</h2>
<p>
  <p>What kind of relations would you use for each of the following models?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Tweets and users</li>
    <li>Users and accounts</li>
    <li>Tweets and hash tags</li>
    <li>Stores and customers</li>
    <li>Shopping carts and items</li>
    <li>Shoppers and Carts</li>
    <li>Shopper and items in the cart that the shopper has</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h2>E3: Omg Really Twitter Again?!</h2>
<p>
  Rebuild Twitter. Create <code>Tweet</code> and <code>User</code> from scratch, without using scaffolding. Make <code>Tweet</code> and <code>User</code> related in a way that makes sense.
</p>
<h2>E4: #relationships</h2>
<p>
  In the app you built above, add a <code>HashTag</code> resource, complete with a migration and a model (no need for routes, controllers, or views quite yet). Make it associated with <code>Tweet</code> in a <code>has_and_belongs_to_many</code> relationship. Don't forget to give it a join table! 
</p>
<h4>Adding content via Terminal</h4>
<p>
  Next, modify <code>User</code> to have many hash tags through tweets. Since we don't know how to add hash tags to a tweet via our website yet, create some users and give them tweets in the <code>rails console</code>. Then make some hash tags, and add them to those tweets. Make sure <code>user.hash_tags</code> returns an array of <code>HashTag</code>s. 
</p>
<h4>Show Me the Tags</h4>
<p>
  Write a route, controller action and view to show all the hash tags a user has ever used in all of their tweets. It should really not be too much code—most of the heavy lifting is done by the Rails relations!
