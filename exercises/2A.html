    <h2>E1: Logic games</h2>
    <p>
      Below are a set of logic puzzles. Try to guess the output of each line. To check your answers type (don't copy-paste) the expression into <code>irb</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>!true && false
true && false
true && !false
x = 6
x < 7 && x > 5
x <= 6 || x < 5
x < 5 || x > 5
(x = 7) && true <span class="comment"># Be careful!</span>
x</code></pre>
    <h2>E2: Too Old for the Club</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new folder for today if you haven't already, called <code>d2</code>. In it, create a new program called <code>strict_bouncer.rb</code>. that gets the age from the console and allows only those in the rage <code>21 <= age < 65</code> into the club.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
20
Too young, fool!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
65
Go back to the nursing home!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
64
Aw yeah c'mon in.</code></pre>
    <h2>E3: Quiz App</h2>
    <p>
      In <code>d2</code>, create a mini quiz that prompts for answers and checks if they are right. Your quiz should have at least 3 questions, and keep track of how many the user got right. Use questions about yourself so your friends can learn about you when they take it!
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby mini_quiz.rb
Welcome to Rafi's mini quiz.
What's my last name?
Khan
Right! You have 1 point.
How many siblings do I have?
2
Wrong...I don't have any. You have 1 point.
What country was I born in?
Bangladesh
Nice! You have 2 points.
Thanks for playing!</code></pre>
    <p class="info hint">A user experience concern: how do you know when to display <code>"point"</code> and when to use <code>"points"</code>? Nothing says n00b like a message that reads "You have 1 points". The given answer doesn't address this question, but yours should!</p>

    <h2>E4: Fizzbuzz</h2>
    <p>
      Write a program (also called a <em>script</em>) that prints the numbers from 1-100, but for each multiple of 3, print "fizz", each multiple of 5 print "buzz" and each multiple of 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz":
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby fizzbuzz.rb
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
...
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
...</code></pre>
    <p class="info hint">The <em>modulo</em> operator returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second. That is, <em>10 modulo 4</em> would return 2. A quick way to check if a number is divisible by another is to see if their modulo is 0. In ruby, the <code>%</code> symbol is the modulo operator, that is <code>10 % 4 == 2</code>.</p>

      Let's continue with our personal pages. Add some styling to give it the look and feel you want. In your <code>username.github.io</code> folder, create a folder called <code>stylesheets</code>, and while you're at it, create a folder called <code>images</code> as well. In <code>stylesheets</code>, create <code>style.css</code>. Then link your stylesheet in your HTML.
