    <h2>E1: Logic games</h2>
    <p>
      Below are a set of logic puzzles. Try to guess the output of each line. To check your answers type (don't copy-paste) the expression into <code>irb</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code>!true && false
true && false
true && !false
x = 6
x < 7 && x > 5
x <= 6 || x < 5
x < 5 || x > 5
(x = 7) && true <span class="comment"># Be careful!</span>
x</code></pre>
    <h2>E2: Too Old for the Club</h2>
    <p>
      Create a new folder for today if you haven't already, called <code>d2</code>. In it, create a new program called <code>strict_bouncer.rb</code>. that gets the age from the console and allows only those in the rage <code>21 <= age < 65</code> into the club.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
20
Too young, fool!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
65
Go back to the nursing home!
$ ruby strict_bounder.rb
Welcome to da hip hoppin club. What's your age?
64
Aw yeah c'mon in.</code></pre>
    <h2>E3: Quiz App</h2>
    <p>
      In <code>d2</code>, create a mini quiz that prompts for answers and checks if they are right. Your quiz should have at least 3 questions, and keep track of how many the user got right. Use questions about yourself so your friends can learn about you when they take it!
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby mini_quiz.rb
Welcome to Rafi's mini quiz.
What's my last name?
Khan
Right! You have 1 point.
How many siblings do I have?
2
Wrong...I don't have any. You have 1 point.
What country was I born in?
Bangladesh
Nice! You have 2 points.
Thanks for playing!</code></pre>
    <p class="info hint">A user experience concern: how do you know when to display <code>"point"</code> and when to use <code>"points"</code>? Nothing says n00b like a message that reads "You have 1 points". The given answer doesn't address this question, but yours should!</p>

    <h2>E4: Fizzbuzz</h2>
    <p>
      Write a program (also called a <em>script</em>) that prints the numbers from 1-100, but for each multiple of 3, print "fizz", each multiple of 5 print "buzz" and each multiple of 3 and 5 print "fizzbuzz":
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby fizzbuzz.rb
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
...
13
14
fizzbuzz
16
...</code></pre>
    <p class="info hint">The <em>modulo</em> operator returns the remainder when the first input is divided by the second. That is, <em>10 modulo 4</em> would return 2. A quick way to check if a number is divisible by another is to see if their modulo is 0. In ruby, the <code>%</code> symbol is the modulo operator, that is <code>10 % 4 == 2</code>.</p>

    <h2>E5: The Fibonnaci Code</h2>
    <p>
      The <em>Fibonacci sequence</em> is one that starts with 1 and 1, and is made by summing the last two elements of the sequence. Thus, the third element is <code>1+1=<b>2</b></code>, the fourth is <code>1+2=<b>3</b></code>, the fifth is <code>2+3=<b>5</b></code>, and so on. Write a program called <code>fibonnaci.rb</code> that takes an integer from the user and computes that Fibonnaci number.
    </p>
    <pre><code>$ ruby fibonacci.rb
Enter a number:
1
Fibonnaci at 1: 1
$ ruby fibonacci.rb
Enter a number:
4
Fibonnaci at 4: 5
$ ruby fibonacci.rb
Enter a number:
10
Fibonnaci at 10: 55</code></pre>
    <p>
      Make sure to test your answers against an online Fibonnaci calculator (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?t=crmtb01&f=ob&i=10th%20fibonacci%20number" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> should do). How long does your code take to compute 10,000? 100,000? 1,000,000? Can you make it faster?

      Let's continue with our personal pages. Add some styling to give it the look and feel you want. In your <code>username.github.io</code> folder, create a folder called <code>stylesheets</code>, and while you're at it, create a folder called <code>images</code> as well. In <code>stylesheets</code>, create <code>style.css</code>. Then link your stylesheet in your HTML.
